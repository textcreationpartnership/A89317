         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>As they have taught us to diſtinguiſh of Converſion wrought at the Sacrament, but not by it; ſo ſome one or other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps occaſionally, if not cauſally, was at ſuch colloquies and tranſactions, if not by them, induced to return to his Duty, and redintegrate the Communion in his Church: Others I found according to that character of St. <hi>Hierom, Facilius vinci poſſe quam perſuaderi;</hi> but having ſundry times by ſome interveniencies and avocations, been fruſtrated of the opportunity of a full carrying through, of the conference which I had entred upon with one among the reſt, who ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to me to have ſollicited with, and engaged others by his influence and inſpirations, and who had new gathered a Church, (if not in that notion, yet much of that nature) I thereupon concluded to give him my ſenſe, and the reaſons thereof in writing; which accordingly I lapt up in one ſheet,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:168423:10"/>and tranſmitted to him by a private, and no vulgar hand: And becauſe I had no thought it ſhould be ſeen abroad, I was not carefull to give it any handſomer dreſs, but onely put it in an homely attire; and having as little ambition as skill to paint to eternity with <hi>Zeuxis,</hi> I took no long time to draw this picture of my mind, which was onely two dayes in forming; ſo that I might plead with <hi>Hierom, Qui non ignoſcit ingenio, ignoſcat tempori;</hi> indeed I rather touched then handled things, and like <hi>Ladas</hi> I paſſed very lightly over the ſands, intending to leave no impreſſion or footſteps of any traverſes betwixt us; but nevertheleſs, as contrariant to my complacencies, as croſs to my expectation, what I intended to ſpeak in the ear, was preached on the houſe tops; for no ſooner was this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Reſcript received, but the Church (as according to the idiom of the Donatiſts they ſpeak) was congregated, and at their tribunal was my baſhful ſheet brought forth (which I rather wiſhed had been ſentenced to perpetual impriſonment) to be publickly arraigned.</p>
            <p>To juſtifie or excuſe the publiſhing hereof, it hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it was not wedded to him under any caution not to communicate or impart it; and that 2. it was expedient to publiſh it to the Church, becauſe they were concerned in it, and they heard but their owne Cauſe pleaded.</p>
            <p>But for anſwer to the firſt; I ſhould have thought, that though I had been ſilent, yet Morality would have dictated, that without my conſent firſt had, nothing of mine ſhould have been made common to any, beſides thoſe to whom I allowed it, and the publiſhing needed my expreſs aſſent to warrant it, not my direct prohibition to reſtrain it. To the 2. Though the Church were concerned in the ſubject and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter controverted, yet that can no more evince an expedience to communicate to them the traverſes betwixt us, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every one of the Nation is intereſſed in the conduct of State-affairs, that therefore it is neceſſary or fit that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould be acquainted with the counſels and agitations thereof: I had no altercation with them; my addreſs was not to the Orbs, but the Intelligence that ſet them on their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and with <hi>Diogenes</hi> I ſtruck at the Maſter, for what I thought more culpable in him then in the Scholars. I never

            <p>For the cenſures which they inſinuate to have attended or prevented the coming forth thereof, as I am not juſtly obliged to be reſponſible for what I was not guilty of, who (as <hi>Memnon</hi> General to <hi>Darius</hi> ſaid his Souldier was) am preſt to fight, not to rail, ſo I cannot diſcreetly undertake to excuſe what I am ignorant of; but if they miſtook not the tinckling of their own ears for outward ſounds, perhaps ſome of their own Cougregation that think themſelves loſers of a juſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of communion, might ſeek their recompenſe by a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in communicating their grieved minds, and <hi>in civitate non libera</hi> (as they made it) would yet have <hi>linguas liberas;</hi> and then I ſhall onely remind them a ſtory of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon;</hi> when one told him that <hi>Nicanor</hi> who was in Court, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by him, ſpake reproachfully of him, he ſent him a large Donative, and ſupplyed his indigence; and thereupon <hi>Nicanor</hi> began to talk very honourably of the King; which made <hi>Philip</hi> to ſay, <hi>Videtis in nobis eſſe ſitum, ut bene vel male audiamus:</hi> but whatſoever thoſe cenſures were, or by whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever aſperſed, as winds bluſtring about the earth are cauſed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:168423:12"/>by vapors breaking out of the cranies thereof, ſo were theſe rumors occaſioned by themſelves that were <hi>pleni rimarum;</hi> and it fared then with them as it uſeth to do with ſuch as buy winds of Witches, who by opening the knots of the ropes given them, raiſe ſo great gales, as make them wiſh them ſtilled again, which they have let looſe, and cannot huſh: Had they done (as <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Zachary, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit generatus vocem</hi>) men might have held their peace, and the Apologiſts had peace; or as it was ſaid of <hi>Bonaventure;</hi> Had they been firſt the dumb Oxe, the world needed not to have wondred till they had lowed: That ever I writ any thing to be anſwered, or that they undertook the anſwer, had never ſlown ſo far, nor ſounded ſo loud but in the winds which their owne birth firſt raiſed; and that which was my deſire, might have been our common felicity, to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged all our volleys with white powder, not onely for the candor, but becauſe (they ſay) it makes no report; and to have reſembled heavenly rather then earthly bodies, the one moving without ſound, the other with buſtling; and ſo never to have come forth upon the ſtage, but to have acted our parts behind the curtain, had not they drawn it aſide, to ſhew what prizes they could play, and to make open ſale of the Bears skin as ſoon as they began to hunt; for what ever cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious omens others had of them, themſelves had endevou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to make the Countrey ring with their celeuſma's, and the Paeans of their triumph for this victory; and though the duſt followed their chariot, wherewith they ſeek to blind mens eyes, yet the creaking of their wheels (and they are onely dry things wanting fatneſs which uſe to move with noyſe) were heard long before they were ſeen to come.</p>
            <p>Yet all this while I was no more anſwered then one man may be by whiſpering in anothers ear, nor did no more feel the ſtroke of their rod, then <hi>Nico</hi> did the blows wherewith his image was beaten by thoſe that made no haſte to encounter himſelf. I might juſtly have expected it, not onely upon the ſcore of Civility, but Chriſtian charity, that I ſhould firſt have been privately admoniſhed of my faults, before the Church had been told thereof; for even a truth unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly publiſhed, is a virtual ſlander; and though I will not

            </p>
            <p>Almoſt two yeares after I had inſcribed and conſigned to them my ſingle ſheet (by which time perchance I might have forgotten that any ſuch thing had paſſed my hands, had I not been awakened to the remembrance thereof by their aſſiduous alarms) I received in manuſcript their anſwer; but in the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, perceiving this my ſmal ſpark by their ſtirring was like to be no longer covered under aſhes, but to be laid open to publick light, therefore leaſt it might expire and vaniſh through its own exility, and ſo waighty a queſtion ſuſtain ſome prejudice by ſo ſhort an anſwer (which <hi>Nebridius</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> friend ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) and ſo ſuddenly formed (which I need not profeſſe, ſeeing, as <hi>Apelles,</hi> when his boy ſhewed him a painted table, and told him that it was done in haſte, anſwered, he might have ſpared to tell him ſo, for the work ſufficiently ſhewed it) therefore as the Tuberous uſe to take their younglings into their bellys again for their better foſtering and defence, ſo I reaſſumed into the wombe of ſecond cogitations this rude <hi>Minerva,</hi> this concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and abortive iſſue of my brain, and new moulded my <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribe,</hi> yet retaining the ſame Scheme of the former black lines, though dilating and filling them with freſher colors, yet kept it cloſe and ſecret, having ſtill a deſire with the old <hi>Romans,</hi> to ſacrifice <hi>mutae deae ad compeſcendas detrahentium linguas,</hi> untill by the veiw of their <hi>Apologie</hi> tranſmitted to me, <hi>I</hi> had the provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and the call to remande my <hi>Diatribe</hi> (the ſame with little or no alteration which here precedes this defence) and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:168423:13"/>they had the virgin proſpect thereof; for ſeeing how undecent it was in them, to proſtitute their anſwer to others eyes, before it was repreſented to mine, I could not ſtumble at the ſame ſtone of offence, ſince as in good things the example merits more prayſe then the imitation, ſo in evil the imitation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves more blame then the example; and together with that review were conveyed ſome animadverſarions on their <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> as velites to begin the Skirmiſh, till time could bring to the ſhocke the waightier armature.</p>
            <p>To theſe animadverſions their Prolocutor replyed, and I rejoynd. But within ſhort time after a gentleman of quality and worth came to me (as he ſaid) from the <hi>Apologiſt,</hi> to tell me, he was very willing to cut off or winde up the thread of controverſie, which he heard I was preparing to draw out farther by forming an anſwer to his <hi>Apology.</hi> But I might be ſuperſeded of ſuch pains; for he deſired I would reſt as ſilent as he had reſolved to be, who would never henceforth have to do with me in any altercation of this kind.</p>
            <p>I (who had always applauded the wiſedom of the <hi>Romans</hi> that ſet the image of <hi>Angerona</hi> on the altar of <hi>Volupia,</hi> and have ever ſenſed moſt pleaſure in ſilence) received with much complacency this amicable offerture, and thereupon laid aſide and took a farwell of the thoughts of making an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and that little Schedule which I had ſcribled, I paſſed this ſentence upon, <hi>tineas paſcat taciturnus inertes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it ſeems they thought that alſo, <hi>per injurias injuriis tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt iter,</hi> and they had learned that principle of <hi>Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell,</hi> that whom they ſtagger with one wrong, they muſt ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly caſt down with more; for although he that read over the Oration which <hi>Lyſias</hi> made for him, the oftner he peruſed, the worſe he reliſhed it; yet it ſeems they better fancying their diſcourſe, the longer they contemplated it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding themſelves under I know not what multiplying glaſſes, fell in love with their own image, and thought themſelves ſo conſiderable, and their way ſo exemplar, as to acquaint the world with ſo much of both, or elſe being as they ſay excited thereunto by importunity of friends (the common vouchee to warrant publications) whereof one hath hung out his buſh at the dore, to whom though perhaps ſome

            <p>Though I had this <hi>Apology</hi> in manuſcript long before it came abroad in print, yet I could not be ſure what alterations it might undergo by new ſublimings, or what increaſe of ſtrength it might make acquiſt of by a <hi>poſſe regni,</hi> aſwell as (they ſay) it did by a <hi>poſſe comitatus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſs I had not enough of that wiſedome which I might have learned from the motto of <hi>Venice</hi> to prepare for war in the time of peace; and the rather, becauſe I had little of that which <hi>Epictetus</hi> calls the ſinews of Wiſedom <hi>viz.</hi> Diſtruſt; but had I not been cajoled by the former meſſage, perhaps my <hi>Jacob</hi> might have come forth into the world holding their <hi>Eſau</hi> by the heel, though I think the birth-right will not be worth them a meſs of pottage, But I ſhall ſoberly profeſs it, as a preciſe and meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red truth, that my Antilogy hath taken up as many hours in the tranſcribing (ſo illegible it hath proved by the haſty and evil hand that drew the originall) as it was in the compoſing.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Hannibal</hi> told <hi>Scipio</hi> had been happier for <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> had been alſo better for us, <hi>viz.</hi> to have kept our ſelves within our bounds and limits, rather then to have come abroad
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:168423:14"/>in ſuch a warfare, and to have confined and incloſed our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance within our own precincts, and not to have laid it open to general notice; the firſt happineſs is to be furniſhed with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the ſecond not to blab our ignorance; and <hi>Quintilian</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Brutus fecerunt carmina non melius quam Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro, at faelicius; quia illos feciſſe, pauciores ſciunt;</hi> and if we had not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps been favoured with the like repute for writing which <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi> acquired for governing, <hi>(capax imperii, niſi imperaſſet)</hi> yet ſurely we had both been held wiſer men if we had held our peace; who though we may fiddle, yet neither of us can make a great city.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Apologiſts</hi> ſhadow is not like to be the longer for this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.

            <p>This hath been the Spring that hath made the waters nought and the land barren, and which needed ſuch ſalt to be caſt into it, <hi>Sal mordacis veritatis,</hi> (as <hi>Hierom</hi> ſpeakes) I am conſcious that this is a tender point, and perhaps as intangible as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſaid ſome others were, which <hi>Luther</hi> medled withall; but as <hi>Mauritius</hi> ſaid of <hi>Phocas,</hi> if he be a coward, he is a Murderer; ſo, ſhould I withhold the truth for feare, I kill thoſe whom I might have profited. <hi>Amyclas ſilentium perdidit.</hi> This is a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to truth; and hony was not to be uſed in any Sacrifice; yet like the Dove, <hi>Si mordeo oſculando mordeo;</hi> for I have endeavoured with the <hi>Spartans,</hi> before the battle to Sacrifice to Love; and with <hi>Hercules,</hi> to hang my ſword in a bough of myrtle, which was Conſecrated to Love, but <hi>Non amo niſi offendero;</hi> I love their perſons, all whoſe opinions and practiſes I am not in love with; nor could I truly love them, did I not love them in and for the truth; he that is <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> is alſo <hi>primum ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum;</hi> and as God the chiefeſt good, is the formal object and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of all love, ſo thoſe material objects muſt alſo be loved in relation to him, and as thoſe to whom we would communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate that Soveraigne good and prime Truth, whereof they are participable; and therefore, <hi>Nemo me poteſt uti amico &amp; adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latore.</hi>

            <p>If my way of writing ſeem an attempt to go out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rode, and yet to miſſe the way, and too long for the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Geſts, or Stages.

            <p>It was the advice of <hi>Auguſtin</hi> that in places infected with Hereſy all men ſhould write that had any faculty, that all ſorts of people among many books might light upon ſome; and perchance it might be as convenient to have the books written, in all kind of wayes, that all ſorts might meet with theſe which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:168423:20"/>ſuited them; and ſome there be, that when there is corn in the ſack would be glad to find ſilver alſo in the mouth; and though they cheifly wiſh the ſword ſhould cut, yet are better pleaſed to ſee the hilt alſo well hatcht, and the edge to be ſet on by the grownd-ſtones of the Philiſtines; and I confeſs though I have endeavoured to head my arrowes aſwell as I could, yet I know, they would have flown the farther and peirced the deeper too if they could have been well feathered; and though I have ſought to ſerve up ſolide meat, yet I think it would have better taken the pallat, and been received into the ſtomach, if it had had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſauce; and though my poverty forbid the banes, yet I like the motion made by <hi>Euripides,</hi> to wed the Graces to the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and if I could therefore, I would with <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> have written not onely <hi>Picta ſed ſculpta;</hi> and though <hi>Nobis non licet eſſe tam diſertis,</hi> yet notwithſtanding, <hi>In magnis voluiſſe ſat eſt;</hi> and the ingenuous acknowledgment of what I ought to have done, may excite others that are able to do it (and ſo <hi>Fungar vice cotis, acutum Reddere quae valeat ferrum, exors ipſa ſecandi,</hi>) that ſo books may be redeemed from beggery, and the diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the pen become more ſublimed, which for the moſt part, carry too much of the dreggs, and thereby the blatant herd may be diſcouraged and ſhamed to make ſuch uſe of thoſe which in their hands are Gooſe-quills with a witneſs.</p>
            <p>For the length of the Treatiſe, though the thread thereof be not ſpun out in any aequality to theirs, who replied in twelve ſheets to one of mine, and this Diſcourſe is returned in farre leſs then a twelvefold proportion, yet it is very true that I have been reminded by ſome judicious Friends, that ſo limber a Diſcourſe as theirs is, did merit no large or full grown An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; but as when certain <hi>Grecians</hi> entertained by <hi>Lucullus</hi> with a coſtly ſupper, ſaid, they were ſorry he ſhould be at ſuch coſt for them; he anſwered, Not ſo much for you ſakes as for mine own; ſo the paines I have taken, was not becauſe their <hi>Apologie</hi> was worth ſo ample an Anſwer, but becauſe the Controverſy was worthy of a full and diligent handling.</p>
            <p>I confeſs alſo, I could never relliſh that Greek Proverbe, that A great book was a great evil, unleſs it were a great evil book.

I deny the neceſſity of a poſitive trial, to make a ſcrutiny and ſearch into them for ſome real worthineſſe. I conceive him viſibly worthy that is an intelligent, and no apparently ulcerous member of the viſible Church. I do not judge, that they are to admit none that are not otherwiſe viſibly worthy, but ought not to exclude any that are not viſibly unworthy. I think it not neceſſary, that all that are admitted ſhould have demonſtrative ſigns of holineſs; but ſuppoſe it enough, that they are not ſignally wicked. I conceive it not ground ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to exclude them, that their lives are ſuſpitious, unleſſe their crimes be notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; perſons ſcandalous, and openly flagitious, we may ſeparate from us: from others that fall not under that notion, we may not ſeparate our ſelves. And a power to act in ſuch caſes, the Miniſtery need not complain wholly to want, even in Churches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presbyterated, much leſſe upon pretence of ſuch want, ſuspend the Celebration and administring of the Sacrament altogether; for they may aſſume as large and free power to exclude ſome ſuch, even where no conſistorial, juridical, formal proceeding can be had, as they now take to put by, and interpretatively to excommunicate all, which they do, while they (at leaſt many of them) adminiſter it to none, but intermit the uſe thereof altogether, or exhibit it to very few or none (in compariſon) but to ſuch onely as they have gathered into a new Church; and therefore as one being asked where he found his interpretation concerning <hi>Conſtantines</hi> donation (as another his gloſs upon the <hi>Salike</hi> Law) anſwered, If any looked on the back-ſide of that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation (and ſo of that Law) there it was to be found: ſo might it be more aptly ſaid, that from whence they derived the power and liberty to excommunicate all by non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>administration, or ſo many by non-admiſſion, they might fetch a right to exclude per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſcandalous (yea and apparently ignorant.) But our <hi>Rhodus</hi> and <hi>Saltus,</hi> our preſent queſtion is, whether it be not onely profitable, but neceſſary, antecedently to the Communion, to make examination, notional or real, of the knowledge, or the lives not onely of ſuch, who upon morally probable grounds, may well be ſuspected to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent for ignorance or crime, but of all indifferently, ſo as for want of will in any to ſubmit to this probation, they may juſtly be debarred the Sacrament; and for want of power or means in the Miniſter, to exerciſe this Diſcipline, he may lawfully intermit the adminiſtration, or adminiſter it onely to ſuch as will ſubmit themſelves thereunto, gathered and convened (and not by their proper Paſtour) out of diſtant places, and ſeveral Congregations.</p>

               <p>They <hi>are not moved to hear men count and call good ways new, and the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of true Doctrine have always loaded it with this Title (which confirms them to ſee the ways of their government have the ſame lot) and therefore this principle of Antiquity yeelds but a popular and fallacious Argument.</hi> But few I ſuppoſe will be moved with this argumentation, as not fallacious enough to impoſe upon popular judgements.

               <p>Thirdly, If that be a popular and fallacious argument which is derived from a principle made uſe of commonly by Hereticks, or others, thereby to give a ſpecious luſtre to their own Opinions, and caſt an odium on their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, then Scripture it ſelf may be ſentenced to be a principle, yeelding onely popular and fallacious arguments; for who knows not, that moſt Hereticks have ſought to fortifie their Opinions with pretence of Scripture, and have upbraided their adverſaries with want thereof?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, when any pretend antiquity to give countenance to novel and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable Opinions or Inſtitutions, by turning the wrong end of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective, to make things at hand ſeem to be far off: the fallacy is not in the principle, but the men that abuſe and falſly apply it; nor lies it in the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, but the aſſumption.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, ſeeing as <hi>Hierom</hi> tells us, <hi>Mendacium ſemper imitatur veritatem,</hi> the argument is the more ſpecious, and like to carry more force, becauſe ſubtil falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiers have aſſumed it; for they being wiſer in their Generations, would not lay on thoſe colours that had no beauty or luſtre; nor would they ſet that ſtamp on their counterfeit Coyn, did they not know it would make it paſs more cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hierom</hi> (ſay they) <hi>is condemned, for deſiring leave of</hi> Auguſtine <hi>to erre with ſeven Fathers, but they dare not, nor are willing to give this liberty;</hi> but yet they take as much, when in the queſtion, whether <hi>Judas</hi> communicated of the Lords Supper, they mention twelve late Writers, and not all of them, <hi>aut magni aut bonì nominis,</hi> aſſerting the negative; and ask, who would not erre with ſuch as thoſe are? But we ſay, though we would not erre with the Fathers, yet we leſs diſtruſt our ſelves to erre with them, or when they are on our ſide; and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſuppoſe our ſelves fartheſt from erring, when neereſt to them.</p>
               <p>As the Scripture bids us to remember <hi>Lots</hi> wife, ſo they ſay to the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Antiquity, <hi>Remember the Gibeonites:</hi> Had this <hi>Memento</hi> been limited to falſe Pretenders of Antiquity, it might have been plauſible: but if themſelves had not forgotten to take ſome of the ſalt of that Pillar, whereinto ſhe was turned, to have ſeaſoned their diſcretions, they never would have made this inſtance indefinitly, and without limitation: For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, it follows not, becauſe they counterfeited old things, we may not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage that which is truly ancient; or becauſe ſome ſtones are counterfeit, therefore none muſt be precious Jewels.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it may be retorted on themſelves, the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> would not have ſimulated that, which had it been true, would not have been effectual to the ends for which they fained it; and had their bread, and bottles, and ſhooes, been as old as they diſſembled, <hi>Joſhuah</hi> might, and would have accepted, and been at peace and in league with them. And will it not then be conſequent, to ſuit the Apodoſis to the Protaſis, in this Allegory or Similitude, that Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a likely Plea, and lends a good Topick; and ſuch things as wear her Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and bear her Character, are more receptible than thoſe that want them?</p>

                  <hi>WHether their way be grounded on the practice of the Primitive Church, is the great thing in queſtion, and ſubject-matter of this Congreſſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be begged in the entrance.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:168423:32"/>of the ancient Church, much leſſe doe they reckon it a great thing, no: would they willingly have it brought into queſtion upon this ſubject; ſo far are they from making it (antomaſtically) the ſubject-matter of this Congreſſe, well knowing, that to re-ſearch into the judgments and practice of the Ancients, is with <hi>Roderick</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> To break open a Temple, where they ſhall onely finde Images of men armed againſt them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Magentinus,</hi> an Interpreter of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> tells us, That a begging of the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is, when that which is propoſed to be proved is uſed as a medium to prove it ſelf, or when we uſe a medium, which ſeems to differ from the queſtion, but is all one with it.</p>
               <p>Now let any man caſt eye on the Paper, and ſee what in that place I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to prove, and what medium I uſe for proving it; and then judge whether I offend in begging the queſtion; or whether I may not queſtion, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſts need to beg more ſpeculative knowledge concerning that Sophiſme, though already they know as much practically, as any men that ever I met with.</p>
               <p>I firſt inſinuated, that Antiquity claimed reverence, and Novelty carryed ſuſpicion: Next, that if the new way of the Apologiſts had ground or warrant from Gods Word, the practice of the Primitive Church, the demonſtration of Reaſon, or did manifeſtly conduce to the advance of Godlineſſe, I ſhould not check with it for its Novelty (in relation to our age) but when many good, and moderate, and rational men were unſatisfied, that it had any ſuch ground. or warrant, or tendency; and it ſeemed to me onely ſupported by popular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes and ſimilitudes, I could not but excuſe thoſe that conformed not to it.

               <p>Let me firſt ſay, that it is not ſufficient to warrant their way, though it did perchance conduce to advance of godlineſſe in ſome acts or ends; for things are not denominated good onely from their ends or conſequents; <hi>Bonum ex integra cauſa, licèt malum ex ſingulis defectibus:</hi> as in Logick, <hi>Ex falſis verúm<expan>

I doubt not but the fire of Purgatory hath holpe to ſublime and purifie ſome ſouls in this life, which it never did in the next; and, as Birds at <hi>Cair,</hi> are hatch'd in Ovens by heat of fire, ſo that Purgatory fire hath produced many good works, though perhaps (as they ſay of theſe Birds) all of them may have had ſome blemiſh; though no man can <hi>malè uti virtute,</hi> yet he may <hi>bene uti vitio:</hi> As there are pious frauds, ſo there are pious injuries; there may be <hi>ex rapina holocauſtum,</hi> yet ſacrifice is no plea or protection for robbery; nor may I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive men of their right, with deſign to make them more diligent and ſedulous to recover it, or others to preſerve theirs.</p>
               <p>But <hi>their way ſhames and reſtrains ſinne, therefore conduceth to godlineſs:</hi> and it were ſomewhat indeed, if it onely ſhamed and reſtrained ſin; but it ſhames (by rejecting from the Sacrament) many that are not culpable of ſcandalous ſins, and reſtrains the uſe of thoſe means, which properly and directly (being Gods Ordinance) have a tendency to the preventing and beating down of ſinne.

If other mens eyes and obſerving of them excite to ſome watchfulneſſe, and ſo conſequently improves godlineſſe (as they ſay the <hi>Tortoyſes</hi> eggs are hatch'd by her eyes) it is the profeſſion of godlineſs that occaſions men to be obſerved; not formally, as it is profeſſed in their way.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This is therefore either to impale and confine all profeſſion of godlineſs to be in their way, and no other, or they conclude ſophiſtically; for this which is but an accidental effect, is not proper to the profeſſion of godlineſs in their way, but common to ſuch profeſſion in any way whatſoever; yea, it is common to an hypocritical profeſſion: for whoſoever makes any ſhew to be of the City of God, is ſet on an Hill, and cannot be hid. The ſmalleſt motes are diſcerned in the Sun, and he that pretends to more light, ſhall never be in the ſhade: and invidious obſervation, like the Sun-beams, reflects moſt upon that ground which ſeems to riſe above the Level: Yet I truſt this cannot excuſe hypocriſie, or blanch it with a tendency to godlineſs onely, becauſe a bare profeſſion to be good, makes men more curiouſly obſerve others, whether they are ſuch or not.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>in regard of the mutual watchings they ſubmit unto:</hi> They that can watch over each other when they dwell ſome of them at neer 30. miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, have either as admirable eyes, as he that could from the <hi>Promontory</hi> of <hi>Lilibaeum</hi> in <hi>Sicily</hi> diſcern the number and bulk of the Galleys that came forth the Port of <hi>Carthage;</hi> or elſe have that rare <hi>Catoptrick</hi> which Fryer <hi>Bacon</hi> is ſaid to boaſt of, whereby he could read things in the Moon, that were reflected from the Earth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>through the benefit of many private Exhortations and Duties, whoſe Light and Heat may both kindle and cheriſh gracious affections.</hi> The more faulty are the Apologiſts, not to make them publick and more communicable, ſince Light and Good are diffuſive, and they kill as many as they might have benefited: Is it lawful to doe good, or to do euil? ſaith our Saviour, ſhewing good not done, is doing evil.</p>
               <p>But firſt, why can they not be as watchful over themſelves or others, if they had a communion of Sacraments with others, as now when they ſeparate from them? Why ſhould not their private Exhortations and Duties, if made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and others brought to partake thereof, have as great influence, in order to the advance of godlineſs, <hi>intenſivè</hi> toward themſelves, and greater <hi>extenſivè</hi> in relation to others.</p>
               <p>Hath their Watch no other ſpring to ſet the Wheels a going, but hope to be rewarded with the Sacrament, in ſuch a ſingular way, whiles others are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? as if they would not
<q>
                     <l>—Virtutem amplectier ipſam</l>
                     <l>Praemia ſi to ll as:—</l>
                  </q> Sure then their Watch is onely to obſerve the time.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if upon admiſſion of a multitude, the Sphere would be too great for their virtue to extend unto, and the Horizon too large for their watchful eye
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:168423:34"/>to make inſpection through; yet nevertheleſſe they need not by ſome general obſervation of the reſt, remit or neglect their ſpecial watch over ſo many, as now they look after: and methinks it ſhould be no leſſe difficult to be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful over many collected in one Pariſh, than over ſo few diſperſed, at ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in ſo many Pariſhes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if thoſe be evil whom they deſert, they are like to fall worſe by ſuch deſertion; but I cannot ſee it likely, that themſelves ſhould grow leſſe godly by their communion; in the natural body, when any parts are ſick, all the hope of help from within, is in thoſe parts that are ſound (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concernment) ſome men are like ambergrice, which though it have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful odour ſimply and by it ſelf, yet begins to ſmell moſt fragrantly in compoſitions; and thoſe conſonants which among themſelves, nor ſpell, nor ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie any thing, yet joyned with vowels, doe form a perfect found; <hi>Aliquod bonum propter vicinum bonum;</hi> There is a winning by converſation, (as one ſtick kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles another) the example and emulation of good men, the deſires to approve themſelves to ſuch (as <hi>Antigonus</hi> called <hi>Zeno</hi> his Theater; and <hi>Aeſchines</hi> never did better, than when he ſpake in the preſence of <hi>Philip</hi>) and the awe they have of ſuch (as <hi>Cato</hi> kept the whole Theater in order; and of like influence was it in the Poet to be <hi>Coram Bruto</hi>) conduceth much to meliorate actions and perſons.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, why ſhould they more diſtruſt themſelves to be like the Grape in this quality, <hi>Uvaque livorem contracta ducit ab uva,</hi> than the reſt to reſemble it in this property, <hi>Botrus circa botrum citiùs matureſcit?</hi> True goodneſſe is like <hi>Elixir,</hi> that by commixion with baſer metals, improves them, not imbaſeth it ſelf; like Light, hath more ſplendor amid darkneſſe; and like fire, heats more by an <hi>Antiperiſtaſis:</hi> and is their goodneſſe onely of affinity with the <hi>Sentida,</hi> which withers, if any touch with it?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, if by this ſeparation themſelves like the ſpirits and extractions of <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> become more pure and virtuous; yet what becomes of <hi>caput mortuum,</hi> thoſe dregs of the people, as they call them? they not onely loſe the influence of their godly Examples, private Exhortations, and Duties, but the fruit and help of the publike Ordinance, from which they are retrenched: Cannot theſe men go to Heaven, unleſſe alone, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaid to <hi>Pupian?</hi> Is the good leſſe, becauſe communicable? (which is as much as to ſay, good is leſſe good, becauſe it is good; for the nature of good, is to be communicable) Or is their eye evil, becauſe Gods and his Churches is-good? As he that ſaw the <hi>Votive Tables</hi> in <hi>Neptunes Temple</hi> of thoſe that eſcaped ſhipwrack after their Vowes, asked, Where were the Monuments of thoſe that were drowned after they had vowed? So what becomes of them that be excluded, while theſe are ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by their appropriate exerciſes? Is it fit that ſome men ſhould feaſt, while the moſt ſtarve? Is it not better that many ſhould receive <hi>Sportulam,</hi> than a few <hi>rectam?</hi> Doth their way advance godlineſſe, in thoſe whom they reject? which are divers hundreds, to one they admit: If it advance the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous quantity of godlineſſe, ſure it doth not the diſcretive. How many in ſo many years, have they gained to godlineſſe; that is, to their way (for as <hi>Tychonius</hi> ſaid of his Donatiſts, <hi>Quod volumus ſanctum est</hi>) how much have they enlarged their <hi>Pomaerium</hi>'s? I think there need no <hi>Libri Elephantini</hi> to record and catalogue their Proſelytes: they ſay, the goodneſs of Phſifick is beſt
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:168423:34"/>demonſtrated <hi>à posteriori,</hi> by the effects in working; and ſure they cannot boaſt much of what in this they may have wrought or effected, when their Prolocutor hath above 5. or 600. in his Pariſh, and hath not (I take it) above 5. or 6. of them ſublimed into his Church by all his Separations.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, are there none godly but they? Or they more godly for this way, and would not have been godly, or not ſo godly but for this way? Are they of this way more godly, then many that are not of it? If they evince this, <hi>Herbam porrigo;</hi> if not,
<q>Urbem defendam dum vita atque arma ſuperſint,</q> I cannot with truth ſay of all, nor will ſpeak with reproach of any, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth of the <hi>Donatiſts, Damnant foras quod intus operantur;</hi> Yet I ſay, that if they deny there are as godly men that croſs their way, as any that walk along in it, whereas they ſay, they boaſt not of their holineſs, I ſhall tell them, that they not onely boaſt, but falſly boaſt thereof; the light of ſome of them doth ſhine, but we cannot diſcern it make any extraordinary blaze, and their Lights need ſnuffers too, as well as others: they are many of them perhaps godly men, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominating them from the better part, and according to their general courſe, not every particular action, and by their main end, not every of their ways, they have their alloy and rotten grains, and muſt be weighed with their grains, as well as other men. And though I am none of thoſe who like Leaches ſuck out the corrupt blood; or like Quails, feed upon poyſon; neither do delight to ſtirr ſtinking Carrions, which ſhould rather be buried; yet there are publike Records which cannot be hidden, of grievous and execrable crimes, whereof ſome of their Communion (who were not onely <hi>ex domo novitiorum ſed profeſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>) have been convicted, and which they have confeſſed; but though they do not expreſly boaſt of their holineſs, yet they are conceited thereof, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly and interpretatively boaſt of it, while they ſeparate from others, as not holy enough for their Communion, and ſuppoſe they ſhould be polluted to communicate with them. All righteouſneſs is by compariſon; and though <hi>Guic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciardine</hi> ſaid of the Popes, that he was a good Pope, whoſe wickedneſs exceeded not other mens; yet they that profeſs to be holyer then others, and reject others from their Communion onely becauſe not holy enough, if they be not much better then other, they are much worſe; and as thoſe little Globes that have a Diurnal motion about the Sun, we ſay are ſpots in the Sun, which yet are Stars, and would other-where be ſo denominated, were they not ſo neer his out-ſhining light: ſo that holyneſs which would be paſſable in others, will not be tollerable in them that pretend to ſo much; and it muſt be a greater Star that ſhall appear of any magnitude in any higher Sphaere.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God hath given ſundry of their Meetings ſo much experience of growth, as to knowledge and affection this way, as plentifully confutes this Paradox:</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes it in order to themſelves perhaps, if they had ſtood in doubt thereof; not to others who cannot take notice of, nor have ſeen ſuch experience. But this is but <hi>Teſtimonium domeſticum,</hi> the belief hereof is reſolved into their own teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; and it is ſtrange, that in a Democratical Church-Government they would imitate the Prerogative of Monarchs, and write <hi>teste meipſo: Moſes</hi> his face ſhined to others, and he knew it not; but it ſeems their ſhines, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves onely know it. But what improvement of graces ſoever hath been oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by their Meetings, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith of the Miracles wrought by <hi>Hereticks,</hi> they were done to confirm that truth which they held common with
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:168423:35"/>the Church, not their Heretical Opinions; ſo that increment of goodneſs was cauſed by the word and prayers at theſe Meetings, not formally, or the rather as they were Meetings in a way of Separation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The old impure way of Pell-mell tends to many evils, it ſtrengthens the hands of the wicked:</hi> And for this we muſt take their word, unleſs it can be proved by <hi>Jeremy</hi> 23.14. (Where though I find the Prophets of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for ſtrengthning the hands of evil-doers; yet I do not read any thing to perſwade me, that they did this by admitting them to the Sacraments and Sacrifices:) Or can be confirmed by <hi>Luke</hi> the 13.26. where is mentioned, that they that ſhall ſtand without ſhall ſay unto the Maſter of the houſe, <hi>We have eaten and drunk in thy preſence, and thou haſt taught in our ſtreets:</hi> But I did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver till now imagine, nor I think did any other dream, that this was eating and drinking at the Sacrament: or if it were ſo to be underſtood, then to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to the Word preached alſo, may as well ſtrengthen the hands of the wicked, as to give them admiſſion to the Sacrament; for they plead as well his teaching in the ſtreet, as their eating and drinking in his preſence: And I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther think it worthy very ſerious conſideration, whether their way of excluding men <hi>pell-mell,</hi> and in the lump, doth not ſeem more to ſtrengthen the hands of the notoriouſly wicked, while they ſee no other cenſure, or deteſtableneſs in this kind fall on themſelves, then befall ſuch as are innocent of Crimes noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.

               <p>Secondly, while wicked men enjoy the priviledges of the godly, it will be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to convince them of their impenitency and want of converſion: It ſeems then, that (as <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us) as the preſence of an Adamant fruſtrates or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpends the attractive virtue of the Load-ſtone, ſo the Word by participation of the Sacraments is defeated of its power to teach, to convince, or to judge, and ceaſeth to be quick, and powerful, and piercing, &amp;c.

               <p>To raiſe our Structure the higher, and make it ſtand more firmly, we ſhould perchance dig the Foundation deeper; and becauſe this erroneous principle is the Fountain of thoſe bitter Waters of ſtrife, our <hi>Marah</hi> and <hi>Meribath,</hi> it might ſeem expedient to caſt a little Salt into the Spring of thoſe Waters to heal them. A Covenant is a mutual compact or bargain between God and Man, conſiſting of mercies on Gods part granted over to man, and of conditions on mans part required by God: it reſults from Gods antecedent and voluntary love that he entred into paction with man, and performeth his abſolute promiſe of giving Faith and perſeverance to his Elect: to which promiſe no condition is imaginable to be annexed, which is not comprehended in the promiſe it ſelf,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:168423:36"/>but to Gods Covenant of conferring other mercies, which flows from his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent love (which is a natural property in God, whoſe proper nature inclines to reward good and evil) is a reſtipulation and condition of duty annexed. Of this conditional Covenant onely (the former being indeed rather a promiſe then a Covenant, being onely Gods act, without any mutual act of man) the Sacraments are divine external ſeals (and I ſuppoſe it is no ſuch juſt cauſe, as may legitimate a war, whether it be more proper to ſay, they are conditional ſeals of the Covenant) to teſtifie and confirm unto us, that we ſhall ſurely acquire what God hath promiſed, if we ſeal back as it were our counterpart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and performing the condition render unto him what he requires, as a conditional promiſe is made abſolute by performance of the condition, which otherwiſe obligeth not.</p>
               <p>That the Sacraments are not Seals of the abſolute Covenant, nor ſet to without reſpect to the condition, carries the ſtamp or ſeal of the Corporation of Proteſtants, and thoſe which have ſet their hands to any Writing againſt <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> in that controverſie of the efficacy of the Sacraments, have atteſted this truth. And ſome others of the Luminaries of our own Sphaere have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected much light upon the point.

Beſides this, we are now diſputing of Gods Covenant and Promiſe in time, not of his Decree before all time. <hi>If thou believe, thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> is not of the nature of a practical decree, but of a promiſe, and is onely doctrinal and <hi>enunciative:</hi> neither do we (as they do) make Gods Decree conditional, but onely the execution thereof, and not the will of God to ſave but the ſalvation of man, Gods eternal purpoſe in ſaving
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:168423:36"/>being abſolute in reſpect of any cauſe or condition impulſive in the object, not in regard of the means in the execution, and order to the end. Gods promiſes for their form correſpond not with his purpoſes, his promiſes being according to the manner of his executions, but his purpoſes have a different method: What he purpoſes, he performs for the matter, but not as he purpoſed for the manner: he ſaves in the ſame manner that he decreed to ſave; but in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting or ſaving doth not follow the ſame order which he did in decreeing: this which is laſt in execution, is firſt in intention;

               <p n="2">2. Not to queſtion why the Sacraments, (or indeed this of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and not Baptiſme alſo) are made the priviledges of the godly, and not other Ordinances alſo: Or how external and ſenſible Ordinances can be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of an inviſible and indiſcernable Society: Irregenerate men admitted to the Sacraments enjoy no proper priviledges of the godly; but as is their Faith, ſuch are their priviledges: A common Dogmatical or Hiſtorical Faith externally profeſſed, gives them title to the common external ſeals of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
               <p>External Ordinances are not onely priviledges of the godly <hi>in facto eſſe, ſed etiam in fieri:</hi> and either the Apologiſts muſt ſay they are never deceived in theſe which they admit, or elſe ſometimes notwithſtanding their caution, themſelves are not priviledged from communicating the Sacraments to the unregenerate; and in ſo doing, they ſet the ſeal to a blank, and co-operate to their damnation, and the act contracts more of guilt in them then it can do in us, in whom it is for the impulſive cauſe, onely an errour of charity; and for the matter thereof, if it ſhould be evil, yet is not ſo formally to us, becauſe we are not thereof convinced in our Conſciences; whereas they impoſe upon themſelves a neceſſity of acting that, which they can have no infallible aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance they ſhall not fail in doing of, and yet are perſwaded the failer thereof occaſions that which cannot be lawfully done. As it is no obvious thing or facile work for any man to obtain an evidence of his own regeneration, ſo it is infinitely more perplext and intricate to acquire ſuch aſſurance concerning another: and therefore upon this principle, that the Sacrament appertains to none but the truly regenerate, as the doubting ſoul can never approach, and ſo the ſick be caſt into an incapacity of a Phyſitian that moſt needs him, and the weak in Faith be fruſtrate of that which was inſtituted for confirming thereof, and the humble ſoul will be moſt afraid to come, and the preſumptuous be

               <p>Farther, when the Sacrament which is Gods external Seal of this promiſe is applied to an unbeliever, it hath all that is eſſential to Gods actual ſealing of the truth thereof, the promiſe being made and publiſhed, the Sacrament by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution ſignifying it, by ſimilitude repreſenting it, by ſanctification aſſuring it, and God thereby engaging himſelf to verifie it; in reſpect of external ſealing nothing more is done to a true believer, (for of internal ſealing and making the external to be ſucceſsful or efficacious, is not the queſtion, neither may we confound the external ſealing with the inward, which is made by the ſpirit onely) nothing is done more in relation to ſealing to him that performeth the condition, than to him that fulfilleth it not. As when a Writing is ſealed and delivered to the uſe of two to become a Deed when a condition is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with, or elſe to be as an eſcrol, he indeed that obſerves the Condition onely hath the eſtate thereby conveyed, but the ſealing is alike to both. And this Conditional propoſition is an abſolute truth, even when made unto a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate: though it be falſe that he believes, and that he ſhall be ſaved, yet it is true, that if he believe he ſhall be ſaved; for if the connexion be true, though both parts ſeverally conſidered, or though one or other of the parts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into a Categorical propoſition be falſe, yet the propoſition is true;

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:168423:39"/>ſave believers, and partly on our inſufficiency to know who ſhall believe.</p>
               <p>And if this propoſition be no falſe teſtimony when it is held forth in the Word, wherefore ſhould it ceaſe to be true when it is given in the Sacrament, why ſhould the ſame thing be true when propoſed <hi>thetically,</hi> generally and to the ear, and falſe when applyed <hi>hypothetically,</hi> particularly and to the eye; as if the eſſence of truth conſiſted in the manner and way of repreſentation, and not rather in the adaequation of things to the underſtanding? If they ſhall object that the Sacraments are mutual engaging ſeals, and as Gods ſeals on his part, ſo ought the receivers to ſet their ſeals to the counterpart, and when God obligeth himſelf to be their God conditionally, they abſolutely promiſe to be his people; and therefore when wicked men partake of the Sacrament, in them at leaſt it is a falſe teſtimony, while they profeſs to be what they are not; and becauſe all that are within the Covenant of Grace <hi>de jure</hi> ſhould be Saints, they ought to exclude all ſuch of whom they are not ſatisfied and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that they are ſuch <hi>de facto.</hi> I anſwer, 1. That I grant there ought to be the anſwer or reſtipulation of a good conſcience in all for to be ſaved, but not in all that partake of the ſeals of grace and ſalvation. Yet whoſoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives them doth or ought to ſet his ſeal to what is thereby ſealed to him, which is onely, that he that believes in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall be ſaved. 2. Let them aſſign a cauſe why the ſame reaſon holds not in Baptiſme, and why upon that account they adjourn not the baptiſing of Infants, till they can render that ſatisfaction, ſeeing Baptiſme is a ſeal of the Covenant as well as the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and the ſeal is ſet to a blank when the baptiſed hath no faith, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as when the Communicant believes not. 3. Not to mention that there is a kind of mutual Covenant between God and Man, in hearing of the Word, God obliging himſelf by his promiſes there revealed, and in us there is a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual engagement and profeſſion of our religious reception of Gods will, and ſubjection of our Conſciences thereunto with belief of his truth, hope of the good there promiſed, and love of God, which therein reveals himſelf, all which though wicked men ſeem to profeſs, yet nothing thereof they perform. But to inſiſt on prayer, there is the like mutual Covenant, God obligeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by his promiſe (though indeed as <hi>Durand</hi> aptly,

But do not wicked men in all this flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him with their mouth,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 78.36.</note> and lye unto him with their tongues? and if then men muſt be ſuſpended from the Sacrament until they approve their holineſs to the ſatisfaction of the Church, leſt otherwiſe they make an hypocritical engagement and falſe promiſe, it ſeems to me to follow that upon the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they ought not to be admitted to prayers.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:168423:39"/>if they muſt be rejected from the Sacraments till they give convincing ſignes of their ſanctity, becauſe all that are admitted to joyn in this higheſt act of Church-Communion (as they ſtile it) ought <hi>de jure</hi> to be Saints, it ſeems to me that till they render ſuch ſigns they ought to be excluded altogether from all Church-Communion, and to be accounted as Heathens and Publicans, and no members at all of the viſible Church; for the Church and Saints by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſignifie the ſame thing, and all ought to be Saints that are of the Church.</p>

               <p>Divine Inſtitution, doth not alter the nature of things, nor moral and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive mutations infer real; the myſtical uſe muſt be diſtinguiſh'd from the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical; and from this uſe ſuperadded to their nature they became ſpiritual, and Sacraments; none but thoſe that were capable of that uſe (which not beaſts but onely rational Creatures could be, (did partake a Sacrament; and it had been an hard ſaying, if the Apoſtle had told us, that Beaſts did eat and drink ſpiritual meat and drink (as he calleth this.)</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That upon the ſcore of this Argument, both Infants, and all flagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious perſons, ſuch as were theſe Idolaters, Fornicators, &amp;c. may be alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Lords Supper: But for anſwer (beſide that one knot is not untwiſted by tying on another) wee do here onely argue that Sacraments formally as ſuch, are not proper privileges of real Saints, or abſolutely incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to any, but ſuch as have given ſatisfaction of their Holineſs (which is their <hi>hypotheſis,</hi> againſt which we are here diſputing) and ſo much I think is fully and cleerly evinced by this inſtance; but yet though they are not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely incommunicable, We do not aſſert, nor is it here upon conſequence, that all Sacraments may now practically be communicated to all perſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are arguments drawn from other conſiderations, beſides the nature of Sacraments in general, which limit and reſtrain their uſe. As for Infants, (to whom yet the Apologiſts will not affirm the Sacraments to be abſolutely incommunicable, for themſelves admit them to Baptiſme) as they were in that time to Circumciſion; and there being no more that we can find required to qualification for thoſe extraordinary Sacraments than was requiſite to Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, which was onely to be within the Covenant, immediatly in their own, or mediatly in their Parents right, Infants were in a capacity to receive theſe, as well as the ordinary Sacraments. Beſide, an argument drawn from the Infants eating Manna, may paſs in the next rank to that which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> collected from the drinking of Beaſts, which might make a natural, but could no moral uſe thereof, and take it as common food, but not as ſpiritual, or as ſigns and pledges of better things. A principal end of the inſtitution of the Lords Supper, was the commemoration of his death, for which Infants are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent; and here is an expreſs command for a man to examine himſelf, which Infants are not ſuſceptible of; and upon this account they are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> though they are to Baptiſme, being capable of the uſe and end thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> to initiate them into the viſible Church, and conſtitute them members thereof, and engage them to the faith and obedience of Chriſt, and work upon them ſome other relative effects, in all which a <hi>paſſive</hi> recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſufficient, whereas in the <hi>Eucharist</hi> an active is requiſite; Adult intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent perſons though criminous, have a potentiality to make ſuch uſe, and do ſuch acts, whether actually they do or not, though perchance they are incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of an holy and effectual uſe or actions; yet notwithſtanding I do not think (as <hi>Paraeus</hi> doth not) that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did explicitly underſtand the myſtical uſe of the Cloud, Rock, and Manna, yet moſt of them implicitely did ſo,

               <p>But who hath not read in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> of a rhetorical, cryptical, and implicite Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme, which <hi>Logicians</hi> ſay is uſual, <hi>Ornatûs aut brevitatis causâ;</hi> and which by a tacit ſupply of one propoſition is made up perfect: Children when they firſt learn to read, ſpell every ſyllable, but grown more skilful, they make up and pronounce every word at its firſt aſpect: ſo I think the like of diſcourſes, where any verſed in arguing can readily analyſe the ſpeech, and by a mental ſupply of what is onely implyed, finde the force or fallacy of the argument. Though I have cenſured others for popular Rhetorique, the Impoſture of our times, yet not as rhetorique, but as <hi>Enervous,</hi> where affections are onely wrought upon, reaſon not at all; and which being reſolved, appears but like a Calf made out of golden ear-rings. Whether mine be of the one, or the other kind, neither my ſelf nor the Apologiſts are competent Judges, who perchance may both look on it through a Perſpective, though I at one end, they at the other of the Glaſs; and at the one end all things appear greater, at the other leſs than they be. But however it be, though they (as <hi>Creſconius</hi> did St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi>) do ſlight and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid my rhetorique (ſuch as it is) having perchance the like quarrel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto which he had to <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> his Candle, becauſe it ſtood in his light, and they have ſome affinity with <hi>Cleon,</hi> who uſing to hold the worſt ſide in the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes he pleaded, was therefore always inveighing againſt Eloquence; yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance ſome may find more implicite Syllogiſms in my Rhetorique, than Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick in their explicit ones.

               </p>
               <p>I conclude, that <hi>I cannot but excuſe ſuch, as at the ſound of ſuch Muſick cannot fall down and worſhip the Image which</hi> Nebuchadnezar <hi>hath ſet up; I make their holy and Chriſtian way, the means</hi> (antonomaſticè) <hi>of ſpiritual life</hi> (though I truſt all are not ſpiritually dead that partake not of theſe meanes,) <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezars Image and Idolatry, and their Exhortations, moving ſoules to their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety (as tending to Reformation, and ſome riſe of order)</hi> ſo as it ſeems they only are of the Reformed Religion, whereas they onely reform the Church militant in the Military notion; (as Troops and Companies are ſaid to be reformed when they are leſſened) <hi>This is Pagan Muſick; Magnum crimen Caie Caeſar, &amp; ante haec tempora inauditum!</hi> But are the Apologiſts in earneſt, and will they as much blemiſh their Charity, to think I intended this, as their diſcretion, to ſuppoſe that this can be inferred from my expreſſions? If I ſeem to conclude bitterly, it is becauſe the ſtomach vitiated the tongue with choler, therefore every thing taſtes bitter: Doth it more imbitter them to hear the ſame thing dreſt in a Rhetorical figurative expreſſion, than in a ruſtical and blunt Language; <hi>Acuto quàm retuſo telo vulnerari commodius ſit,</hi> ſaith the great Phyſician <hi>Celſus.</hi> A compariſon reflects more light, and impreſſeth more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, than a ſimple contemplation. If I had ſaid I could not but excuſe theſe that could not dance after their pipe, would not that have irritated them with the harſh ſound thereof? And what do I in that other delivery of my ſelf, but ſignifie the ſame thing in other words? <hi>Scaliger</hi> tells us of a Maid that ſounded at the ſight of a Roſe (as <hi>Cantharides</hi> are killed with ſmells of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:168423:44"/>ſweet flowers) and it ſeems the Apologiſts are offended with a poor Flower of Rhetorique, a Roſe that hath no prickles. Allegories are but implicit and contracted ſimilitudes, which as they muſt not be wreſted beyond their ſcope, and (as Heralds ſay of Bearings) the reſemblance muſt be taken from the beſt of their properties, not the worſt; ſo he that ſhall apply all that to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the <hi>apodoſis,</hi> which agrees to the ſubject of the <hi>protaſis,</hi> will forfeit as much of diſcretion as of charity. In that Allegory, <hi>(viz.)</hi> where the dead carcaſs is, there will the Eagles reſort; the carcaſs refers unto, and ſhadows out our bleſſed Saviour, but dare any to be ſo fooliſhly blaſphemous, as to apply unto our Saviour other properties of a carcaſs than that one of conveying his Saints to him as Eagles to a carkaſs. Do not the Apologiſts in the cloſe of this Section, tell us in the phraſe of Scripture, of Adders ſtopping their ears to them, and of their piping to them that have not danced, and ſhall we have ſo little wit or ingenuity, to ſay they grant themſelves to be Charmers or Fidlers? With as much colour of juſtice do they complain elſe-where, that I lay Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick to their charge, in ſaying their gathering others from their proper Paſtors into their Church, reſembles that Magick which ſome <hi>Romans</hi> were ſlandered with, of charming and bringing other mens fruits into their Fields. As <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid of <hi>Heraclitus</hi> his Works, What I underſtand, is good; what I underſtand not, I beleeve is good: So when they elſe-where complain of deſpiteful Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies caſt upon them, who will not contrariwiſe be apt to ſay, what I know hath no cauſe of complaint; and therefore I beleeve what I know not is as cauſleſs.

Thoſe whom for form ſake they call their Elders, may perchance ſometime heretofore have co-operated, not as Phyſical, but Moral cauſes, <hi>ad quorum praeſentiam, non efficientiam ſequitur effectus,</hi> to whom therefore I cannot allow the nature of Conſonants, which though mute of themſelves, have their ſound when joyn'd with Vowels; but thoſe having no vital principles, they are rather like <hi>Architas</hi> his Dove, and <hi>Regiomontanus</hi> his Eagle and Fly, which move by theſe Wheels which they make and ſet, and whereof they order the ſpring; and yet alſo it is very obvious and tranſparent to all about them, that theſe Wheels have been rarely or never ſet a going about the Work; for one or two of the Miniſters onely made tryal and judgment, and admitted or laid aſide as they liſt, which I think they will not deny; or if they ſhould, I could verifie by particular inſtances.</p>
               <p>But whatſoever be the neglect of others, the Apologiſts have now redeemed their faulty omiſſion of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> the frequent Celebration whereof they ſenſe to be their duty; and ſo <hi>ſecundo poſt integritatem gradu conſistunt,</hi> and are almoſt innocent, becauſe (as they ſay) humbled: The leſſer evil hath ſomewhat of good, and it is well that they ſee, and farther from evil, that they have in any degree reformed their fault, God may in his good time reflect one beam of light more upon them, and make them ſee that they have yet no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe rectified their ſinne of Omiſſion, than as he doth, that idly ſate ſtill, and then ſtarts up to run a wrong way.

Nay, ſome of their Women impatient of that Gagge which the Apoſtle had ſet in their mouthes, as if not fitted for this age, wherein he did not fore ſee that Sex ſhould become ſuch able Speakers, had their frequent interpoſitions, even to the modelling of their Meetings and Exerciſes, <hi>Diſcunt, proh pudor! à feminis, quod viros doceant;</hi> ſo as their Congregation had ſomewhat of Analogy with the State of <hi>Athens,</hi> where <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> ruled the City, and ſome other governed him.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:168423:46"/>Prolocutors own Pariſh, who yet upon ſome emergencies would have owned the Church, and appropriated the gathering thereof to himſelf, ſo as however he elſe-where ſpeaks of finding a Church ſetled at <hi>Pyworthy,</hi> to colour his ad jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thither from his proper charge; yet it was of his ſettlement onely upon this occaſion: and though that Pariſh Church had then a Miniſter, yet he that hath ſince ordinarily officiated there was long onely a candidate of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</p>
               <p>This abridgment of their Church-Hiſtory, will ſet this whole Diſcourſe in more light, and put us right in the true ſtate of the queſtion agitated between me and the Apologiſts, which had its riſe and reſult from their proceedings: <hi>Nonnulla pars eſt inventionis noſſe quod quaeras,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> They ſay, <hi>the Author is unacquainted with their way,</hi> (and it had been happy if none had ever been acquainted therewith:) It is probable, they have their Cabala's, for at their Aſſemblies they have ſought to ſet <hi>Harpocrates</hi> at the door, that ſome of the myſteries of their way might be as ſecret, as the Holyes of <hi>Ceres:</hi> but the thingnow in queſtion,

               </p>
               <p>But we erre in ſaying <hi>they examine all,</hi> which they deny that they do; <hi>ſuch as are more knowing, and are willing,</hi> do onely make profeſſion of their Faith and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſome publickly, ſome more privately; which is in effect to ſay, that they do not examine them in one point, but in all: there is no more difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween examination upon interrogatories, and a large continued profeſſion, than between a Pedlars laying open his whole Pack, and his ſhewing forth ſome few parcels, that ſome may enquire for; or than when a perſon is ſuſpected to have filched ſome commodity, between his ripping up, and ſhewing out all the laps and receptacles of his garments, and the Officers making a particular re-ſearch into them. By compelling men to make profeſſion, they make (in effect) an examination of more particulars, and put them under a more difficult tryal; as to give a brief anſwer to a queſtion, is more eaſie, than to make a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Oration. And if this profeſsion be not an examination, let them exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelves: how can they reconcile theſe two aſſertions, <hi>That they do not examine all,</hi> and <hi>that in the reformation of a corrupt Church</hi> (which they ſay is the work they are about) <hi>it is neceſſary to examine all,</hi> without convicting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to omit to do that which they ſay is neceſſary.</p>
               <p>And if profeſsion therefore be a kind of examination, how can that alſo cohere with truth, or with it ſelf, that <hi>they examine none but thoſe which may well be ſuſpected of incompetent knowledge;</hi> and yet they bring under this profeſsion ſuch as are knowing. And if none he examined, but ſuch as may be well ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected of incompetent knowledge (which we not ſuſpect, but know in ſome particulars to be otherwiſe, unleſs they are of the humour of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of <hi>Sicily,</hi> who admitted all to have recourſe to him, ſave thoſe he expected treacherous; but yet ſuſpected all for ſuch, that he might admit none,) then ſuch as are not of competent knowledge being uncapable of admiſsion to the Sacrament; and they admitting not the reſt of their Pariſhes, becauſe they ſhould be, and will not be examined: how can it conſiſt with what they tell us elſe-where, That <hi>it is enviouſly ſurmiſed, that they think all thoſe uncapable, whom they admit not:</hi> And
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:168423:47"/>if they will examine all, and yet do examine none but ſuch as may well be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected to be of incompetent knowledge, it is as little to the honour of their Miniſtery, as to the credit of their peoples proficiency, ſince <hi>Diogenes</hi> thought the Maſter was to be ſtricken, when the Scholar play'd the Truant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The omitting of the uſe of Sacrament</hi> (they ſay) <hi>concerns them not:</hi> but ſure it doth, becauſe they omit it in their own Pariſhes and charges, where it is their ſpecial and proper call to adminiſter it, and they omit to diſtribute it to all that come not under their examination.</p>
               <p>That <hi>about convening from divers Pariſhes, will but confound the diſcourſe if mixed with it,</hi> (and indeed it is like to confound all the ſpecious diſcourſes they make in defence of their way, as I ſhall endevour to manifeſt anon) <hi>moſt of thoſe admitted were taken in, not without their proper Pastour.</hi> I will not divide the houſe upon that tryal; but whether theſe that were admitted with their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour, were culpable of Schiſme, we ſhall hereafter examine: in the mean time, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> imputes Schiſme to thoſe that were admitted without their Paſtour, <hi>Eccleſia est plebs ſacerdoti adunita,

And though I deny not that they renounced and proteſted againſt all other communion with the Orthodox, as well as in the Sacraments (to which heighth and wideneſs of ſeparation the Independents have not riſen or remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) yet do they ſymbolize with them in the kinde, though not degrees of their Schiſme; for there may be ſeveral ſtories of building one higher than another, yet all upon the ſame foundation: And theſe Duties notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding wherein they communicate with others, they account no acts of Church-fellowſhip, or Eccleſiaſtical Communion, but ſuch as they can diſpenſe unto Pagans alſo. And themſelves alſo ſeem to conſtitute the root of Church-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip in the Communion of Sacraments, owning none to be of their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but ſuch as communicate with them of the Supper of the Lord.

As whom they admit, have liberty given to beleeve what they liſt (liberty in things of the minde, being the great bait or <hi>philter</hi> of Independency) ſo thoſe whom they reject, are like enough to take liberty to do what they liſt, little or no care being taken of them; and they being caſt off without any great crimes, may be careleſs what they do, ſince they can ſpeed no worſe, though their crimes become greater.

               <p>It is no new thing to transfer upon others our proper faults: <hi>Me ſuo nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne exulem vocat;</hi> as <hi>Nero</hi> ſet <hi>Rome</hi> on fire and charged it on the Chriſtians, and yet all the time of the burning too he ſang ſome of <hi>Homers</hi> doleful verſes: but <hi>ori digitum,</hi> for the fore-finger that uſed to ſtop the mouth, had the attribute of <hi>ſalutaris</hi> from antiquity.</p>
               <p>But to revert to the queſtion, as ſtated by the Apologiſts. If there were no other Gulph between us, but the neceſſity of Examination of our knowledge, in order to our admiſſion to the Sacraments, we might ſooner come together: but yet, firſt, why this ſhould be onely neceſſary in the reformation of a long corrupted Church, and not be of a ſtable permanent neceſſity (ſeeing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is always needful in every Communicant, and they will be ſatisfied that every one is knowing, and that ſatisfaction cannot be had without examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they pretend) they have not favoured our ignorance ſo farre as to tell us; and I doubt we ſhall need not onely ſome <hi>Delian</hi> diver, but <hi>Elias</hi> himſelf to come to reſolve us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In reformation of a long corrupted Church there may be an obviouſneſs of reaſon to examine thoſe that are corrupt, or ſuſpected to be ſo, but all are not ſo (we hope,) and why all ſhould then paſſe under examination, our dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs needs to be prompted to apprehend the reaſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It had had more of rational congruity to examine in reforming an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Church, rather than a corrupt, for there may be knowledg enough, where there are corruptions too many.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We are left in a miſt alſo, and need to have it cleared up to us, how they underſtand the Church to be corrupt; whether with the <hi>Browniſts</hi> (the <hi>comparative degree</hi> of this ſeparation) they ſuppoſe the reformed Churches to be corrupt in the firſt conſtitution, and in <hi>Eſſentials,</hi> which though directly they affirm not, yet implicitely and by conſequence they ſeem to ſay it; why elſe do they gather new Churches, and ſeparate from the former Congregations? Among Heathens they might finde a proper ſpheare for ſuch activity, not here; if there be Churches already gathered to their hand; and they cannot, in my ſenſe, ſtand firm and unſhaken upon this degree or ſtair, unleſs they aſcend to the <hi>ſuperlative degree</hi> of ſeparation, and require a farther probation in order to the re-acception of the other Sacrament; and ſo as the Papiſts upbraid us to have had no Church before <hi>Luther,</hi> they will gratifie them farther, confeſſing that till now gathered by them, we had none ſince.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If they ſuppoſe corruptions onely in <hi>Accidentals,</hi> in doctrines not funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental (but that charge they have ſeemed to wave;) or in diſcipline and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, this indeed is the way to keep the power in perpetual exerciſe, <hi>&amp; qui velit poteſtatem, perpetuam velit,</hi> for whatſoever the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> may talk of a Church in this world without ſpot or wrinkle, yet as <hi>Beda</hi> tells us (who according to his wont took the hint thereof from <hi>Augustine</hi>) while the Apoſtle ſaith,

               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:168423:49"/>
               <p n="6">6. And of neceſſity we muſt caſt dirt in the faces of the Churches of God, that have preceded us, as well in dignity as time, if in reformation of a long cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Church this examination be neceſſary. The godly Judges and Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> with the aſſiſtance of the Prophets and Prieſts, oftentimes had a zeal like fire to conſume the grown corruptions, and purge and purifie the Church; yet there is no light that there was any ſuch fiery tryal of thoſe that were to come to the Sacrifices or Sacrament. St. <hi>Paul</hi> begot the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to Chriſt, and that body by many diſtempers ſoon grew corrupt, and in purifying thereof, the Apoſtle preſcribes no ſuch looking to the ſtate of thoſe that were to be admitted to the Sacrament, he onely commands every man to examine himſelf, none to examine another; not to take our Proſpect at too great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: The Morning Star of the Reformation aroſe to diſpel and clear the contagious Miſt of Popiſh Errors, Superſtitions, and Uſurpations; yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcern the leaſt foot-ſtep of any ſuch way of examination, but whoſoever profeſſed a deſire of Communion with them, was accepted and received into fellowſhip with them in the Sacraments, unleſs by any notorious crime he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And if the queſtion thus ſtated be the mark the Apologiſts ſhoot at, let us with a touch onely, and in general here, try how their arrows will fit or reach it. They have muſtered up in the 25. and following Sections, ſundry Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments grounded on Texts of Scripture, to verifie their judgment, and defend their practice: Doth any of them conclude the queſtion thus ſtated? I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you try in which of their Syllogiſmes is this <hi>Theſis,</hi> the concluſion; <hi>It is neceſſary in the reformation of a long corrupt Church, that all members thereof ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to ſome examination of their knowledge.</hi> Nay, which of them mentions any examination, (onely one Text ſpeaks of giving an anſwer, but not to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) or which ſpecifies the Sacrament, as that in order whereunto the duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned is to be performed? one excepted, where is a command for men to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelves, none to ſubmit themſelves to be examined by another. The <hi>withdrawing from, noting, not eating with, not giving holy things, or caſting pearles, ſhutting up, keeping out,</hi> &amp;c. is to be underſtood (in their own ſenſe) of men of wicked lives, nothing here intended of men defective in knowledge, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can examination be concluded out of the Texts, but by making <hi>petitio principii</hi> the <hi>medium, viz.</hi> that what is there injoyned as duty, cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with, but by ſuch examination. But then for the limiting and reſtraining of all to the time of Reformation of a long corrupt Church, the <hi>Chymiſts</hi> that can extract oyl out of ſteel and flint, <hi>volitant velut umbrae,</hi> compared with theſe men, whoſe omnipotence of Logick can create ſomething out of nothing. Who ever till now ſuſpected, that onely in the reformation of a corrupt Church <hi>things ought to be done in order and decency? The precious to be ſeparated from the vile, that we ſhould be delivered from unreaſonable and evil men, and withdraw our ſelves from every brother that walketh diſorderly; That we must not cast pearles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Swine, and give holy things to Dogs, nor be partakers of other mens ſins; that we ought to obey them that rule over us,</hi> &amp;c. As if at other times, when a long corrupt Church is not to be reformed, we need not, nor are obliged to do any of theſe things. <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſeeing a roving Archer, ran to ſtand at the mark as the ſafeſt place; ſo ſurely all the Apologiſts ſhafts are ſhot ſo extremely wide, that I may willingly chuſe to keep my ſelf at this mark, which they ſet up for
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:168423:50"/>the ſtate of their queſtion, and yet never fear to be hurt with any of their arrowes.</p>
               <p>Concerning examination the paper did never abſolutely oppoſe it as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedanous to this Ordinance (as they ſuggeſt.) I might ſay to the Apologiſts as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> did to <hi>Creſconius, Lege prius diligenter contra quod ſcribis, aut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellige quae dicuntur, aut noli quod intelligis vertere in aliud;</hi> for the very firſt inſpection into the paper will cleare it of that charge: it is denyed to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that all be examined, but it is affirmed of ſome (<hi>viz.</hi> ſuch of whom there is a violent ſuſpicion that they are ignorant) that it is meet they ſhould be examined, and theſe propoſitions carry neither <hi>Diagonall,</hi> nor interpretative contradiction.</p>
               <p>Though they have not yet prompted us with the leaſt <hi>Jota</hi> of Scripture that might enforce this examination preparatory and diſpoſitive to the Sacrament, nor helped us to the ſmalleſt colour of reaſon to evince it to be more requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, in order to the Sacrament, than other Ordinances, yet we ſhall here tell them:</p>
               <p>Firſt, that wee doe not ſo much queſtion the conveniency of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining, as the neceſſity thereof: <hi>Durum eſt quod neceſſe eſt,</hi> ſaid <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian.</hi> As love is the ſweetning of labour, and <hi>ubi amor eſt, non eſt labor, ſed ſapor;</hi> ſo neceſſity is the imbittering of all undertakings, like the Salaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which if laid to the root of a tree, it never flouriſheth or proſpers. <hi>Quod cogitur, altera mors eſt.</hi> As the <hi>Coloſſus</hi> at <hi>Tarentum</hi> might be moved with a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but not at all ſtirred, if one ſet his whole force to it; ſo many may be facil to goe that are impatient to be driven, and leſſe cheerfully chuſe to doe that which they cannot chuſe. It is a memorable Story which <hi>Cardan</hi> tells us of him in <hi>Millaine,</hi> who having in ſixty yeers been never without the Walls, yet when the Duke hearing thereof ſent him peremptory command ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to goe out of the Gates during life, he that before had no inclination to doe ſo, yet ſoone dyed with greefe to be denyed the liberty of doing it: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe therefore we would not be brought under a yoke or into bondage of any thing, we ſtrive to ſtand faſt in that liberty wherein, we thinke, God and the gifts which he hath given us, have ſet us free.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We doe not altogether diſpute whether they may call men to examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as whether it be ſo neceſſary, <hi>ratione medii,</hi> ſo as that if they will not come under it, they have power for that cauſe onely, to keep them from the Sacrament.
<note place="margin">Lo.

We know that Gentlemen of this Nation that travell into <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> upon the offer of themſelves are ordinarily admitted to partake the Sacrament, without examination, and even in the Church at <hi>Charenton,</hi> the moſt celebrious of the Nation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We doe not ſo much oppoſe this pretended power of examination, as the conſequence of it. As <hi>Qui veterem fert injuriam, invitat novam;</hi> ſo if we give place to one impoſition, we make way for more, and as in Gods Law, he that offends in one point, is guilty of all; ſo in mens commandments, he that gives up his liberty in ſubjection to one thing, forfeits it in all, for even in this concernment, <hi>Eadem eſt ratio partium &amp; totius,</hi> and if obedience be due to one command, it is alſo to more, that ſhall come ſtamped with the ſame authority.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Neither doe we at all conteſt againſt an expediency of examination re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively to ſome perſons, ſuch as lye under a violent or morally probable ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicion of ignorance, <hi>Quando intercedit ſufficiens ratio ad generandum dubium,</hi> as the Schoole defines it, who being convicted to be ignorant, we deny not but it is fit their approach be ſomewhile retarded, untill they are better inſtructed; but ſuch whoſe underſtanding in the Goſpel is well known,

               <p>But though palpably ignorant perſons may be excluded, yet it is a fallacy of the conſequent to conclude that therefore all muſt be examined. There are ſome that are elevated above all ſuſpition of ignorance, and there are other wayes of diſcovery of ignorance beſides particular examination upon interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories. Themſelves tell us, that they examine none that are taken to be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, and therefore they may know them to be ſuch without examination, by their education, diſcourſe, actions, and imployments.

               <p>But to diſpute, <hi>No ignorant perſon ought to be admitted, therefore all ought to

               <p>And however, we cannot thinke it fit to examine ſilly Maid-ſervants, what is the Eſſence of God, that is a depth too great to put an Elephant in, much more a Lambe; The Philoſopher could ſay, <hi>De Deo hoc tantùm dic, Eſſe;</hi> and <hi>Gregorie</hi> better, <hi>Ne vocabula quidem Dei naturae congruentia reperire homines poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunt,</hi> and therefore <hi>de Deo cùm dicitur, dici non poteſt.</hi>

They require a poſitive probation as neceſſary, and that demonſtrative proof ought to be rendred of their godlineſs, I judge a negative trial ſufficient, ſo as to have nothing againſt them, and that they be not obnoxious for any notorious wickedneſs. They will admit none, whoſe ſanctity may be doubted; I allow onely ſuch to be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, whoſe crimes are notorious: They argue, that becauſe none but ſuch as are fit and worthy ought to be admitted, it is therefore neceſſary to make tryal generally of the fitneſs of all, and not finding a competent number of fit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in their proper charges, that they may ſeparate into a new Church, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and made up onely of ſuch as they judge to be fit; I ſuppoſe the falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the conſequent in both, is the firſt limiting and reſtraining their proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion within anguſter bounds (thoſe that are not notorious or not violently ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, needing no trial; and thoſe that are notorious, being for the moſt part paſt it, and tryed to their hand;) and in the latter I concede no liberty at all,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:168423:53"/>and though <hi>de jure</hi> and ſpeculatively onely fit perſons are to be admitted, yet <hi>de facto</hi> and practically all intelligent Church-members that have made no publike forfeiture of Church-privileges and intereſſes, nor of good exiſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that <hi>bonum depoſitum in aliorum mentibus,</hi> are regularly to be deemed and accepted as fit, and accordingly to be admitted. Theſe are the proper iſſues between us, and what is <hi>heterogeneal</hi> to theſe is <hi>ignoratio elenchi;</hi> and where they ſhould defend theſe <hi>hypotheſes,</hi> and vindicate this courſe of theirs, onely to contend for the power and duty of Excommunication, is it not <hi>Andabatorum more,</hi> to fight blind-fold? or ſeeing it to be beſt for their advantage, to run at tilt, not againſt a fighting enemy, but a wooden image of their own erecting, fitting the mark to their arrows, not ſuiting their ſhafts to their ſcope; and in effect is nothing elſe, than as if a Tyrant, to juſtifie his rapines and perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhould plead the juſt power of Kings to puniſh oſtenders upon lawful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.

Are they <hi>de facto,</hi> groſly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, or notoriouſly wicked and ſcandalous? They cannot ſay it, and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that they think it, let them then recount theſe two aſſertions, That they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all, ſave groſly ignorant, and notoriouſly criminous; and yet theſe whom they exclude, are not ſuch. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> never more urgently preſſed <hi>Petilian</hi> and his <hi>Hyperaſpist Creſconius,</hi> to anſwer that queſtion, <hi>Si Conſcientia certè dantis attenditur quae abluat accipientis,</hi> &amp;c. than I ſhall importune the Apologiſts to ſatisfie this <hi>Dilemma:</hi> Thoſe many whom you reject from the Communion, are either judicially ſentenced for notorious ſinnes, (and then I will confeſs that they are juſtly ſeparate from you;) or elſe not ſo cenſured, and then you muſt confeſs you unjuſtly ſeparate from them. To ſay they are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, is to ſay contrary to what they profeſs, who complain of being defrauded of what they have ſuch a will to partake, <hi>Varus ait, Scaurus negat, utri creditis?</hi> To ſuggeſt it is their fault that they partake not, is to make them culpable for not taking that which they cannot have; for when had they a <hi>Synaxis</hi> in their Churches? To tell them they muſt come at <hi>Pyworthy,</hi> (where he that tells them ſo, is Paſtor of no Church there; thoſe that are ſo told, are not the flock of any Paſtor there) they might as juſtly call them to <hi>Exceter;</hi> and would they come there, they muſt notwithſtanding come under this probation, and wait upon their good pleaſure and gracious opinion, which is the thing queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and ſets the buſineſs in the ſame poſture as before, after all theſe pallia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. So that in the concluſion, when they tell us elſewhere, he that puts them to prove that perſons knowing and not ſcandalous may be excluded, ſhall hear of their refuſal; we muſt ſay to them, we do indeed hear of their refuſal, but it is onely to prove this, not to do it, whiles they exclude theſe whom they dare not ſay; and if they did, we ſhould knowingly gainſay, that they are ignorant or ſcandalous.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond, that my Conceſſions look one way, my Arguments another, (as if like the <hi>Parthians</hi> I turn my face from that mark I ſhoot at; or like <hi>Fauſtus,</hi> that pretended to write againſt <hi>Pelagius,</hi> yet half juſtified him) it had been a juſt debt, if not to me, that I might ſee my error; yet to themſelves, that we might ſee their truth and ingenuity, to have inſtanced in any one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of mine, that pleads againſt the power and duty of Excommunication. No, when the Civil Magiſtrate is become both the Sonne and Father of the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:168423:53"/>Church, I doe not think that the opening of his <hi>Praetorium</hi> ſhould ſhut up the Eccleſiaſtical <hi>forum exterius,</hi> nor the exerciſing of his ſword, lay the keys aſide to ruſt: Let them not be tryed to open other Locks than they were made for, that <hi>Moſes</hi> may have no cauſe to ſay the Sons of <hi>Levi</hi> take too much upon them; we ſhall no more repine at <hi>Aarons</hi> keys or rod, than at <hi>Moſes</hi> ſword. I am ſenſible theſe are different Adminiſtrations, and have ſeveral reaſons and ways and ends. There are ſome Crimes which need Cenſure, and ſometime the Civil Laws take no hold thereof, nor can the Civil Courts take cognizance of them; and the Magiſtrate puniſheth, though the Offender repent; and is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied when the pain is ſuffered, or mulct is paid, whether he be penitent or not. The Church hath a contrary method in her puniſhments, and which are not properly puniſhments, but caſtigations; the holy and prudential ends thereof I have elſewhere diſplayed: I do not therefore hold it fit to excommunicate Excommunication, though I judge the undue conduct and culpable exerciſe thereof to be ſuſpended. Let it not be 1. too frequently inflicted, it being Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, not Food; and Phyſicians tell us, that Medicines loſe their efficacy by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary uſe; and though <hi>Cacochymie</hi> give indication, yet continual Purgings brings the habitude of the body to a <hi>cachexy;</hi> and in the <hi>Timpany,</hi> to let out all the water without ſtops and intermiſſions, deſtroys the Patient. 2.

I never voted for exorbitant Epiſcopacy, nor ſhould I have ever ſuffraged againſt a regulated; I would have gladly lived under rectified Epiſcopacy, and I am content to be under a moderate Presbytery, (for there are <hi>rigidi &amp; molles Presbyteri,</hi> aſwell as <hi>rigidi &amp; molles Lutheran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All things are apt to be ſoyled by diuturnal uſe, and mens corruptions will have an influence into their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.

And Presbyters are men too, and man hath a connotation of frailty, and never comes up fully to the Standard of the Sanctuary, though I think they hold out weight as much, and need as few graines of allowance to make them paſſable for ſanctity, as any generation of men that I know, ſo that I wiſh we had more of Presbyters, and am ſorry to find ſo few right Presbyters, and that many paſſe under that notion, which are but conterfeits and prevaricators.</p>
               <p>Even my zeal for the honor of Presbytery tranſports me into a diſlike of thoſe which lapſe from their principles, as if they diſtruſted and were out of love with them, and reflect diſhonor upon that name by their recidivations. Nor can I take complacency to find that <hi>Caſſius, Quicquid velit, nimis velit,</hi> and I think it very wiſe and ſeaſonable Counſell which <hi>Galba</hi> gave to <hi>Piſo, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro à peſſimo quoque deſiderabitur, mihi &amp; tibi providendum est, ne etiam à bonis deſideretur;</hi> I ſhould be ſorry to heare it ſaid, that <hi>Diogenes</hi> tramples on the pride of <hi>Plato</hi> with greater pride, and looke upon it with indignation, when thoſe that pretend to be inimicous to Epiſcopacy, are ſuſpected not to be ſo, becauſe as <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Burgundy</hi> excuſed himſelf not to wiſh evil to the King of <hi>France,</hi> becauſe in ſtead of one he wiſhed there were twenty: So they doe not extinguiſh the Dominion, but change and multiply the Subjects thereof, <hi>Magìs alii homines quàm alii mores,</hi> as <hi>Tacitus,</hi> and they doe onely as he ſaid of <hi>Mucianus, Vim principis complecti, nomen remittere;</hi> and like what <hi>Coſſitanus</hi> complained of in that Hiſtorian, <hi>Ut imperium evertant, libertatem praetendunt, ſi perverterent, ipſam aggredientur;</hi> or like as <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> conteſted not to vindicate liberty, but who ſhould ſeize on the Soveraignty, <hi>Caeſar</hi> would admit no Superior, <hi>Pompey</hi> no Equal; and <hi>Paterculus</hi> tells us of the latter, <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultior non melior.</hi> It grieves me alſo that in ſtead of Independents returning to Presbyters, they are too facil and too forward to turne toward them, in a ſcandalizing complyance, and to be impoſed upon, and ſeduced with their principles, as if (by ſuch a tranſplantation, as <hi>Paracelſus</hi> talkes of in natural generations) there were ſeveral formes in them, but that ſtill reſulteth to give being and denomination which meets with moſt plenteous and ſuitable
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:168423:57"/>nouriſhment, <hi>Ipſi ſerviunt temporibus, ut ipſis ſerviant tempora,</hi> like the <hi>Hyaena,</hi> they are males one yeer, and females another; and like the Mervail of <hi>Peru,</hi> which every yeer beareth different flowers. This hath been the Gangrene of Presbytery, which ſpreads and mortifies, and the Worm which hath ſmote the Gourd, under which our heads hoped to find a ſhadow to deliver us from our grief; ſo that now the Eaſt Winde and the Sun beat upon us even to faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall ingenuouſly confeſs, that as my weak underſtanding cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that the Word of God particularly determines, or abſolutely preſcribeth any one entire form of Church-government, but onely holdeth forth general rules for the conſtitution and exerciſe thereof, as may ſuit with order and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and conduce to edification in godlineſs, and advance of truth and peace; ſo my tractable will is ready to embrace and ſubmit to any that ſhall not check with theſe rules, nor retrench thoſe ends, (as to me Independency ſeems appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently to do; but which elſe ſhall be to thoſe ends moſt ſubſervien, I ſuppoſe may be aptly demonſtrated <hi>ex poſteriori,</hi> and not obſcurely determined by Time the Mother of Truth, and Experience the Miſtreſs of Wiſdome) rather than in an unhappy conteſt about ſetting on ſuch or ſuch a garment on the Church, to tear her fleſh, and ſcatter her limbes, and in a difference about ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the hedge, to burn up or devaſt the field.

               <p>If any ſhall anſwer, that the Apoſtles were enrich'd with an extraordinary talent of knowledge and ſanctity, which fruſtrated and prevented the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of probation. I ſhall reply;</p>
               <p>Firſt, that it is evident by ſundry paſſages of Scripture,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.17. as is evident by <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.9. and knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his death, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.44, 45.</note> that they were then ſomewhat ignorant, yea even of the reſurrection of Chriſt, (without which all Faith is vain) which doth not ſo much diſparage them, as magnifie the powerful inſpirations of that holy Spirit, which ſo ſoon after, and ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly endued them with knowledge, as well as power, from on high, that <hi>Leo</hi> might have ſaid, <hi>Quàm plenè,</hi> as well as, <hi>quàm citò diſcitur, quod docetur, ubi Deus magister est.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſecondly, if the Apoſtles needed not to be examined, becauſe the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of their knowledge and holineſs could not be doubted, then by a proportionable accommodation of reaſon, neither ought ſuch now to be, whoſe competency of knowledge cannot well be ſuſpected, nor lives repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for notorious crimes, which is the iſſue we plead for.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they were clean, but not all; and if Chriſt admitted <hi>Judas</hi> to the Communion of his laſt Supper with the reſt of the Apoſtles (who though he might look with a face of Religion toward the other Diſciples, yet Chriſt, whoſe eye pierced into his heart, beholding him under the true notion of an hypocrite, and without hope of repentance; and yet admitting him together with the reſt, without any ſatisfactory ſigns of holineſs, which <hi>Judas</hi> could not give, and Chriſt needed not to make re-ſearch of, but onely as being at that time no ſinner notorious:) I ſhould gladly learn, by what authority and precedent any that profeſs the Faith, and are innocent of notorious and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ſinnes, which may check with their profeſſion, can be rejected? and by what means the unworthineſs of ſome receivers, can be ſo ſpreading or diffuſive, as to reflect guilt on him that adminiſters, or pollution on the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or prejudice on others that partake in the Communion, ſince the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs of <hi>Judas</hi> could have no ſuch influence. And becauſe the weight of this precedent will ſway very much to the turning of the Scales in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, and the Fathers in their conteſts with the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> made ſo much uſe thereof upon the like occaſion, I ſhall prompt my ſelf with an hope, that it may quit the coſt of time (which is the price of diſcourſes as well as buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) to inlarge in a copious diſcuſſion of this queſtion, Whether <hi>Judas</hi> did partake of the laſt Supper of our Lord? wherein our Antagoniſts are eager, and very much ingaged to maintain the Negative.</p>
               <p>But that our Saviour admitted <hi>Judas</hi> to ſuch participation, is the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of the Fathers,

               <p>Hereunto it is anſwered, That <hi>Luke</hi> relates this by an <hi>hyſtorology</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capitulation, theſe words being mentioned by St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> to be ſpoken by our Saviour before the Inſtitution of his Supper, and it is more like that they obſerved the true order rather than St. <hi>Luke,</hi> one <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> being more credibly to be reduced to the order of two, than two to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of one; eſpecially conſidering that <hi>Luke</hi> relates not the matter of the Lords Supper, according to the order wherein things are ſpoken or acted, becauſe he relates the taking of the Cup; <hi>verſe</hi> 17.18. (which ſome will have to be the <hi>Euchariſtical</hi> Cup) and giving thankes, before the taking of the bread: Beſides (ſay they) <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> record that diſcourſe of the Traytor to be uttered as they did eat, which could not be if <hi>Luke</hi> obſerve the right order, for after Supper he took the Cup, and after the diſtribution of the Cup, <hi>Luke</hi> addes that reflection upon the Traytor.</p>
               <p>Whereunto I ſhall reply, That it hath more veriſimilitude, that <hi>Luke</hi> obſerves the proper order of things, rather than the other Evangeliſts, not onely becauſe he profeſſeth according to his perfect underſtanding of things, <hi>to write in order, Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>verſe</hi> 3. but becauſe he recites both the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and manifeſtation of the Traytor in one continued ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Speech; <hi>This cup is the new Teſtament,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but behold the hand of him,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>But to prevent more altercation about the order of things in the ſeveral Evangeliſts, we finde that <hi>Judas</hi> ſate down among the Twelve Apoſtles, who were not twelve without him; our Lord gave to his Diſciples and they did eat, he bad all drink and all did drink; where is there any mention of <hi>Judas</hi> his going forth before all was ended? <hi>De non apparentibus &amp; non exiſtentibus eadem eſt ratio in lege (etiam divina.)</hi> We purſue our <hi>Quare impedit,</hi> and ask, what ſhould cauſe a writ of <hi>Ne admittas</hi> to be ſued forth againſt <hi>Judas,</hi> who (as <hi>Maldonat</hi> obſervs) had he riſen from Table before all had been ended, he had bewrayed that treaſon, which he laboured to conceale.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, as there is no neceſſity to conclude, that the Sop, if given that night was given before the laſt Supper, neither is there any cogency of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to inferre, that if it had been given before that Inſtitution, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Judas</hi> went forth ſo immediately, as to leave no proportionable <hi>interim</hi> between the one and the other, for the Conſecration and diſtribution of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>So laſtly, there is no certainty that the Sop was given to <hi>Judas</hi> that night when the Paſſeover and our Lords Supper were eaten. And I ſhall crave leave to offer ſome Animadverſions which may make it ſeem not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that it was dealt him at a former Supper in <hi>Bethany,</hi> and that the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per mentioned, <hi>John</hi> 13. was neither the Paſſeover, nor Supper of the Lord.</p>
               <p>That thirteenth Chapter of <hi>John</hi> begins with theſe words, <hi>Now before the feaſt of the Paſſeover;</hi> and then in the ſecond verſe ſaith, <hi>Supper being ended;</hi> ſo as the Supper there rehearſed ſeemes to be before the Paſſeover. The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal annotation on <hi>John</hi> 13.1. referres us for the conſonancy of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts to <hi>Matthew</hi> 26.2. where it is ſaid, <hi>after two dayes is the feaſt of the Paſſeover;</hi> ſo as by comparing the Texts, the Supper mentioned in St. <hi>John</hi> was two dayes before the Paſſeover, and though it be ſaid <hi>John</hi> 12. that <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus came to Bethany ſix dayes before the Paſſeover,</hi> yet the Supper recorded, verſ. 2. of that Chapter, and in the 13. Chapter, might be ſome dayes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his comming, and but two dayes before the Paſſeover, and ſome lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men ſuppoſe that he had that week ſeveral recourſes to and from <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It ſeemes a very Tortious and improper anſwer to interprett <hi>before the feaſt of the Paſſeover</hi>) to be the night of the Feaſt, but before the eating of the Paſchal Supper: There is neither reaſon, nor example, nor authority for it, and it ſounds contrary to common ſenſe, and the two dayes mentioned <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.2. are deſtructive to the interpretation. Beſides when our Lord ſaid to <hi>Judas, (what thou dost, doe quickly,)</hi> ſome of them thought that <hi>Jeſus</hi> had ſaid unto him, <hi>buy thoſe things that we have need of againſt the Feaſt,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this could not be ſpoken in the night of the Feaſt of the Paſſeover, it being then too tardy to make preparation for that which was elapſed, or at leaſt inſtant.</p>

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:168423:64"/>of the offerings upon the fifteenth: let it farther be conſidered, that had this been ſpoken on the fourteenth day of the month at night, when the Paſchal Lamb was eaten, how unlikely it was, that the Apoſtles could imagine that any proviſion could have been made for the next immediate day, ſo late, and ſo unſeaſonable, for it was night when <hi>Judas</hi> went forth.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not lay much weight upon this obſervation, yet it is not deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, that after that Supper where the Sop was given, <hi>John</hi> 13. there is mentioned one <hi>exit</hi> or going thence of our Saviour <hi>John</hi> 14.31. and after that, ſeveral of his Sermons are recited before his laſt going forth over the brook <hi>Cedron,</hi> where was the Garden whither he went from his laſt Supper <hi>John</hi> 18.1. which inſinuates that the Supper mentioned, <hi>John</hi> 13. was not his laſt: And ſince St. <hi>John</hi> ſeems ſomewhat abruptly and without any cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with, or relation to any thing antecedent in that 13. Chapter, to ſay <hi>(and Supper being ended)</hi> it ſeems to me not irrational, nor unparalell to other parts of Scripture, to conjecture that he now reverts to recite what far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther happened at that Supper mentioned in the former Chapter. The <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> have a Proverb, in Scripture <hi>Non eſſe prius &amp; poſterius,</hi> and ſuch <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercalations</hi> and hiſtorical <hi>Epentheſes</hi> are not onely frequent in <hi>Geneſis</hi> and other Books of Scripture, but obvious alſo in the Evangeliſts, as may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the ſeries and order of <hi>Janſenius</hi> his <hi>Harmony,</hi> and it is the firſt of <hi>Tychonius</hi> his rules (which St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> calls keyes for unlocking the hidden things of Scripture) and which he names Recapitulation; <hi>Dicuntur quaedam quaſi ſequantur ordine temporis, vel rerum continuatione narrentur, cùm ad prio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra quae praetermiſſa fuerunt latenter narratio revocetur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Farther Sathan was firſt entred into <hi>Judas</hi> before he had recourſe to the High Prieſts about betraying of his Maſter, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.34. but he had firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Sop before Sathan entred into him, <hi>John</hi> 13.27. (he might have thoughts and tentations of Treaſon before, but he put it not into act or exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution till Sathan had gotten the poſſeſſion of his heart,) therefore he had ſwallowed the Sop before his reſort to the Prieſts. But now from the Supper at <hi>Bethany,</hi> he went forthwith to the Prieſts to drive the bargain with them <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.14. and ſo conſequently then (or before) he muſt needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sop.</p>
               <p>Neither doth this Argument depend onely upon St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s relation of <hi>Judas</hi> his entring into Conſpiracy with the Prieſts immediatly after his recitall of the Supper at <hi>Bethany</hi> (though St. <hi>Marke</hi> alſo obſerve the ſame Method) and <hi>Luke</hi> relates his conference with the Prieſts as before the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, and the Fathers think that he grudging at the waſt of the oyntment beſtowed upon our Lord at that Supper, took thereby the occaſion of his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and ſeeking to repaire his loſſe, findes a way to ſell the oyntment which was already ſpent, by ſelling his Maſter who was anoynted with it, <hi>Damnum quod effuſione unguenti ſe feciſſe credebat, vult magiſtri pretio compenſare,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> but St. <hi>Matthew</hi> alſo, <hi>Chap.</hi> 26.16. (ſaying, <hi>and from that time he ſought opportunity to betray him</hi>) doth evidently ſhew, there was ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of time between his Contract with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the execution of his Treaſon, and therefore conſequently ſome dayes before the Paſſeover he had agreed with them for the acting thereof, conformably whereunto the Antient Church conceived, that <hi>Judas</hi> entred into conſpiracy with the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:168423:65"/>Prieſts on the fourth day of the week, and that his paſſion followed on the ſixt, and in memory of the one, they faſted Wedneſday, and in remembrance of the other, upon Friday in every week.</p>
               <p>Beſides, <hi>Judas</hi> going out at night when he had received the Sop, the time was too anguſt to make his redreſs to the Prieſts, drive his bargain, muſter the Souldiers, and returne to ſeiſe his Maſter, all in that one night, if before hand things had not been treated, reſolved, diſpoſed and ready prepared, in order to the execution. So as Satan being entred into him before he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned the treaſon or went about it, and that entry being made together with the reception of the Sop, he could not receive it in the night of the Paſſeover.</p>
               <p>If any ſhall tell me that the contrary is the common opinion both of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Modern Authors, I ſhall franckly acknowledge it, but ſo is it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that <hi>Judas</hi> received the Supper of our Lord, and if they will aſſume a liberty to diſſent in the one, they muſt yeeld us the freedome to vary in the other.</p>
               <p>Whereas it is objected, that if our Lord had made known the Traytor ſo ſignally at the Supper at <hi>Bethany,</hi> two or three dayes before the night of the Paſſeover, how could the Diſciples be ſo dull or forgetfull to be ſtill igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of him, and to queſtion again who it ſhould be? It is eaſy thereunto to anſwer, That if at the Paſchal Supper, when they think the Traytor was marked out by the Sop, the Diſciples yet noted it not, nor underſtood it to be <hi>Judas,</hi> either through perturbation of Spirit, as <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> or the ſoftneſs of our Lords voyce, as <hi>Janſenius</hi> and <hi>Grotius,</hi> or the charitable and innocent goodnes of their natures, which could neither ſuſpect nor beleeve any ſuch thing of another, more then of themſelves, or becauſe that manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>(thou ſaiſt it) licèt ſit affirmantis non eſt planè affirmantis rem,

For the ſame reaſons they might take as little notice of, and as little apprehend the diſcovery, made at the former Supper at <hi>Bethany;</hi> and what ever ſhall be alleaged to excuſe them, or manifeſt the reaſon of their inadvertency at one time, may alſo ſerve for the other. But that none of them underſtood <hi>Judas</hi> to be the Traytor, even to the laſt, no not St. <hi>John</hi> himſelfe (as ſome learned Men conceive) is evident, <hi>John</hi> 13.18. no man at the Table knew for what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the Lord ſaid, <hi>what thou doeſt, doe quickly.</hi> Had they been perſwaded that <hi>Judas</hi> was the Traytor, could they have thought that <hi>Chriſt</hi> would have truſted him with buying any thing for the Feaſt, or giving ought to the poore, as they conceived he meant by theſe words, <hi>quod facis,</hi> &amp;c. and had St. <hi>John</hi> at laſt underſtood it; doubtleſs he would have revealed it to the reſt, that with one conſent they might have riſen up againſt the Traytor, as <hi>Janſenius</hi> obſerves.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour ſpake of the Traytor at <hi>Bethany</hi> to ſhew he foreknew the plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:168423:65"/>and deſigning, and in the Paſchall night alſo, to manifeſt he foreſaw the acting and execution of the Treaſon. And as for that objection, That had Jeſus told them two days before that one of them ſhould betray him, they had at that time began to be ſorrowful; and to ask, <hi>Is it I?</hi> It may be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto anſwerd, That men are not always equally affected at the relation of the ſame things, they may have divers diſpoſitions, ſuitable to different occurring circumſtances.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they might then alſo be ſorrowful, and make ſuch interrogations, though S. <hi>Iohn</hi> record it not, elſe how wil the Objecter anſwer the Argument, ſhould it be retorted upon him, as that, the diſcovery of the Traytor mentioned in <hi>Iohn,</hi> was not the ſame with that recorded by the other Evangeliſts; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at the one the Diſciples were ſaid to be ſorrowful, and asked, <hi>Is it I?</hi> At the other, not?</p>
               <p>If any ſhall farther object (as my own thoughts by a <hi>prolepſis</hi> prompt me, that ſome perhaps may do) that the lotion of the Apoſtles feet is commonly underſtood to be (among other cauſes) myſtically in order to their prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Sacrament, and an Emblem of the pureneſs thereunto requiſite; and that though it were uſual not onely among the <hi>Iews,</hi> but other ethnick Nations, to waſh before meals, yet to do it after Supper, was proper onely to the <hi>Iews,</hi> and that onely at their Paſchal Supper; whereas ſome learned men ſay, there was a double waſhing, ſuitable to a double Supper; and the ſecond lotion was before the Dimiſſory Supper; all which are Arguments, that this giving of the Sop at the ſame time, with the waſhing after Supper, was at the Paſsover.</p>
               <p>I ſhall anſwer, That ſome of the Fathers have indeed made ſuch alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical applications of this lotion, but there is nothing in the Text to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant it; where other Reaſons thereof are implyed, <hi>v.</hi> 14. and other rendred by the Fathers; as, <hi>Ut ſomnium illud de regno politico meſſiae eis excuteret, &amp; in ſeipſo perfectae humilitatis exemplum ostenderet:</hi> Farther, <hi>Semel lotos baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, eodem lavacro non indigere, ſed hoc lavacrum quotidianis exceſſibus est institutum, &amp; jugis retractatio uſ<expan>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:168423:66"/>previous thereunto; yet I deny that it could not be ſo, though done two or three days before hand. The Jewes had their preparative before the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, and the Lamb was tyed, as ſome think, to the Bed-poſts four days before, that they might better remind the reaſon of the Inſtitution, and diſpoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Celebration; and our Saviour might alſo on like grounds ſome dayes before, prepare his Diſciples for the receiving of that Supper, which he inſtituted in ſtead of the Paſsover.</p>
               <p>Concerning the waſhing after Supper, the learned man which denyed that <hi>Iudas</hi> did partake of the Paſsover, preſſed with this Argument, tells us, that for <gap reason="foreign">

Of this elſe-where the ſame Author gives ſome inſtances; and if this were ſo, the Argument were evaded, and the doubt aſſoiled; for if the Waſhing were not after Supper, then it was not peculiar to the Paſsover.</p>
               <p>But indeed this plaiſter is too narrow to cover all the wound, the Author took no notice of verſe 14. where it is ſaid, he roſe from Supper <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, ſo as this waſhing could not precede it; I therefore anſwer, That this lotion being to an extraordinary end, was not made in the uſual manner and method, and to ſhew it was not to mundifie and fit them in order to that preſent Supper, according to the National Cuſtome; but to another end, and for a myſtery, our Lord inverted the uſual order, and makes that ſubſequent, which was commonly antecedent to Supper. what ever the reaſon were (<hi>&amp; melius eſt dubitare de occultis, quàm litigare de incertis;</hi> and here alſo not altogether unfitly may be applyed that of <hi>Gregory, Qui in factis Dei rationem non videt, infirmitatem ſuam conſiderans, cur non videat, rationem videt;</hi>) it is but a weak Hinge to hang ſuch a conſequence upon, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Iewes</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed not after ſupper, but at the Paſsover; therefore it was at the Paſsover that Chriſt after ſupper waſhed his Diſciples feet: As if I ſhould argue thus, Becauſe the Jews onely at the Feaſt of <hi>Tabernacles</hi> cut down and brought in boughs,
<note place="margin">Tremel. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. in Iohan.</hi> 7. <hi>S.</hi> 2.</note> and cryed <hi>Hoſannah;</hi> (ſo as the boughs and days of the whole Feaſt were called <hi>Hoſannah,</hi> from the uſual acclamations of the people when they carryed the boughs up and down;) therefore our Saviours triumphal entry into <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> when they cut down boughs, and cryed <hi>Hoſannah,</hi> was at the Feaſt of the <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> which in truth was made but a few dayes before the Paſover, which was always kept in <hi>Niſan,</hi> whereas the Feaſt of <hi>Tabernacles</hi> was celebrated in <hi>Tiſri</hi> ſix moneths after.</p>
               <p>If any ſhall now after this tedious diſcourſe interpoſe with <hi>Caſſius, Cui bone?</hi> and tell me that howſoever it may be yeelded that <hi>Judas</hi> did partake of the Lords Supper, yet this cannot conclude an admiſſion of perſons ſcandalous and openly flagitious, ſince <hi>Judas</hi> his ſinnes were then ſecret and uncenſured.

Wherefore <hi>factâ anagoge ab externa lotione ad internam, ex tulit Sermonem,</hi> and ſpeaking to all, in his ſpeech to <hi>Peter,</hi> by the externall lotion, ſhadowed forth and ſignified the internal, either purifying of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and cleanſing the ſtain of ſinne by grace of repentance, or purging of the ſoul from the guilt of ſinne by his blood; (as <hi>Origen, Cyprian, Ambroſe, Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, Gregory, Bernard, Piſcator, Cajetan, Janſenius,</hi> and their own Margine takes notice, that the late Annotations ſo expound it) and the ſpiritual wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, either to be wholly by regeneration, (Chriſt hereby reviving the ſigne that is given of it in baptiſme, as <hi>Diopate</hi>) or dayly, whereby quotidian lapſes are cleanſed, this being as the fruit of Chriſt, his advent into the world, and of his paſſion, ſaith <hi>Bucer;</hi> ſo that this ſentence contains a general doctrine (ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi>) that we are all ſtinking and defiled before God, untill Chriſt abſterge our filthineſs.</p>
               <p>If ſome have ſuppoſed this waſhing to be after the Sacrament, the ſumme is ſmall for number (onely <hi>Cyprian</hi> among the Ancients that I can recognize) and their reaſons of as ſmall waight: that which impoſed upon and miſlead them was <hi>verſ,</hi> 2. <hi>Supper being ended,</hi> but I hope my Eſſayes elſewhere have not left it improbable that this Supper here mentioned, was not had in the Paſchal night, or if it ſhould have been ſo, yet <hi>coenâ factâ,</hi> no more concludes the cloſe of the Supper, then <hi>die facto,</hi> the end of the day; and ſome of the Learned ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſenſe of the <hi>Greek</hi> by <hi>coenâ paratâ;</hi> but if that conſtruction be not plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, others reade <hi>inter coenandum,</hi> or by a Synecdoche <hi>integri,</hi> underſtand the firſt part of the Supper ended, for at the Paſſeover were ſeveral ſuppers or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſes, ſo as it might have been after one of them, or after all, and yet before the Supper of the Lord.

               <p>That <hi>(waſh one anothers feet)</hi> ſignifies, examine your ſelves, is no mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, but their proper fiction; but yet if Chriſt his lotion of their feet had been figuratively inſtructive to the cleanſing of their hearts, in order to a Sacramental preparation, ſelf-examination had been either a part thereof, or means and help thereunto; and if they had been onely leſſoned to examine themſelves, and nothing elſe been ſignified, then it might perchance, as they
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:168423:69"/>ſay, <hi>have ſtood better, if they had been bid to waſh their own feet,</hi> but the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Humility and Charity could onely be propounded by Chriſts doing it, and the ſpiritual waſhing of regeneration was now aptly repreſented, while he made the external lotion, who merited and applyed the internal, and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Miniſter may better diſcover mens preparation, but the generall Exhortations beſt prepare them; and if they ſhall tell me, That Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are or may be intermixed with Examination, yet formally it is the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation inſtructs, and Examination tryes the proficiency, and there is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the inſtruction, none of the tryal; and why a general Exhortation may not without farther tryal, fit men for the Sacrament, as well as for other duties, and while it expounds and lays open and applyes the Word of Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as it ought to do) as well diſpoſe us to recieaing, as the very reciting of the words did prepare the Apoſtles (for we read of no other preparatory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, which they had) I ſhould be glad the Apologiſts would give a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal account before the Greek Calends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If Chriſt did not examine his Diſciples, doth it therefore follow, that they may not examine ſome or all in their Aſſemblies.

I grant he may examine ſome, I deny it to be neceſſary that he muſt all; and ſo much I inferred, becauſe Stripture is ſilent that Chriſt examined his Diſciples, and the conſequence is bottomed on this poſitive Doctrine, current among Theologues, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is Eſſential, or abſolutely neceſſary to the Sacrament, may be colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted out of Chriſts doings and ſayings at the Inſtitution.</p>

But I cannot divine what authority or reaſon the Apologiſts had to affirm, that the 70. were excluded, becauſe more infirm (&amp; ſo not capable it ſeems.) I had thought, that if none but the 12. or 11. (as they would have it) did communicate, it was becauſe they onely were Chriſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Family, as it were, and the Paſsover was to be eaten by one Family to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, if they made up 10. perſons; and Chriſt paſſing from the Paſsover, and tranſlating it to his Supper, admitted no more at the latter, then he took to the former; and ſeeing that it was a Jewiſh Canon, that not above 20. ſhould eate together of one Paſchal Lamb, our Saviour could not perhaps admit of many more than the 12, for that reaſon, if (as it is likely) he conformed to that obſervation.</p>
               <p>But it ſeems then by the Apologiſts, that thoſe whom they admit, are as it were in the notion and capacity of the choice Diſciples, thoſe whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, of the infirm 70. Yet to accommodate it more aptly to what they have ſaid, that <hi>Christ thereby teacheth us to exclude the Ignorant and Wicked,</hi> they ſhould ſay not blanchingly, <hi>the infirme,</hi> but <hi>the ignorant</hi> or <hi>wicked</hi> 70, for ſuch they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them to be by being excluded; and therefore thoſe whom they reject may comfort themſelves with that Martyr, to be ſtock'd in the ſame hole with <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot,</hi> and to be in the ſame condition with the 70 (whom Chriſt choſe notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding) and to be no otherwiſe Dogs or Swine, then they were; but if Chriſt called not thoſe that were infirm,

               <p>IF they could be blaſted by the prejudice and foreboding of the Apologiſts, our endevours to prove <hi>Judas</hi> to have participated the Lords Supper, would be very unſucceſsfull, for if we could lay and keep that ground, yet after all our culture it would beare us no other but <hi>Sodom</hi>-fruit, which we might paint faire, but it would prove but duſt. <hi>Nothing</hi> they ſay, <hi>being thereby conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt their judgement or practice;</hi> but I feare this duſt is in the Apologiſt's eyes, <hi>&amp;</hi>
                  <q>Non vereor nè quid portendant omina veri.</q> They adde, <hi>though Chriſt ſaw Judas to be an hypocrite and admitted him, it onely followes thereupon, but that hypocrites may be admitted, and who thinkes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary?</hi> But they might have had enough Logick to have diſcerned, or ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to have confeſſed that ſomewhat more is thereupon conſequent, to wit, that (known) Hypocrites may be admitted, and to this the Apologiſts think the contrary and profeſs it. <hi>They speake of excluding prophane and ignorant perſons, and are told an hypocrite was admitted, and this they ſay in truth is to paint an houſe that hath no foundation.</hi> Truely there is no colour for it, that this were painting howſoever, but it had been an improper material to build with, if, as they ſpeak of excluding onely prophane and ignorant, ſo they did exclude no other, but though they have obdured their hearts to the excluſion of them that are not ſuch, will they alſo harden their forheads to ſay they exclude none but ſuch, and that all are ſuch whom they admit not? If they dare not ſay that all excluded are ſuch, why doe they ſay they are ſpeaking of ſuch, when they ſhould (as we doe) ſpeake of ſuch as they exclude? If like the <hi>Lamlae</hi> they have eyes prying abroad, and layd up in boxes at home, yet can they vainely think, that others have not eyes in their head, to ſee that they exclude not only ſuch as are ignorant and prophane, but thoſe alſo which by ſubmiſſion to tryal give not ſatisfaction of their knowledge and ſanctity? And doe but obſerve when elſewhere they diſtill the Argument of the Paper, how they more rightly
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:168423:72"/>give us this for the Quinteſſence, <hi>Chriſt admitted Judas to the Communion, therefore what need this prying?</hi> and not as here they would ſuggeſt, therefore ignorant and prophane may not be excluded; ſo as it ſeems not onely by their diſcipline, but by their arguings, they ſuppoſe all men ignorant, elſe they would not dare to argue ſo impoſterouſly.</p>
               <p>Neither is the Argument altogether wide the mark whereunto it was aymed; for if Chriſt exhibited it to <hi>Judas</hi> whom he knew to be ungodly, then the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not the Privilege onely of the Godly, nor is the diſtribution thereof, to ſuch whoſe hearts or lives anſwer not their Profeſſion, a partaking of their ſinnes, or a falſe teſtifying or falſe ſealing, neither are convincing ſignes of the ſound work of grace upon the heart, that which gives the capacity or right of receiving; all theſe ſeeme to be concluded from this inſtance, and all are againſt their judgement and practice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Were they of my opinion, they ſhould manage this argument about Judas, in another ſort?</hi> We might ſuſpect the Apologiſts did ſmacke of ſome of the <hi>Paracelſian</hi> notions, and were facil to beleeve that ſtrong imaginations elevated either by conciliation of an amicable intelligence (as they ſpeak with <hi>Avicen</hi>) or by Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of its Spirit to the Spirit of the World (as <hi>Ficinus</hi> prompts them) can worke Maſteries upon another mans fancy, and make him contrary to his proper notions to beleeve or imagine what they liſt: for how elſe can they be ſo confident to impoſe <hi>(Eraſtianiſme)</hi> on me, an opinion to which I have ſo often and ſo plainly profeſſed my ſelf to be diametrally oppoſite? how well they can manage an Argument, we ſhall have tryal enough, but let us confider the management they would have made of this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt knew Judas to be a wicked man, yea a reprobate, yet admitted him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Miniſters may not keep back ſuch as they know to be wicked; thus the Eraſtians.</hi> If this be the beſt managery they can make thereof, we finde little encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to truſt an Argument in their hands, that will ſo ſoon decoct and evir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate the force thereof, and vitiate and betray it into a fallacy of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent: for from <hi>Chriſts</hi> admitting <hi>Iudas</hi> known to him to be wicked, it follows not that Miniſters may not keep back ſuch as they know wicked, but onely that they may admit them. There is a diſparity between the freedome and the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of admiſſion, but if they underſtand by the Miniſters knowing them to be wicked, a private knowledge, then I ſhall profeſs it to be my opinion, that a Miniſter may not keep them back; and <hi>Chriſt</hi> his admitting <hi>Iudas</hi> whom he knew to be wicked, will ſuppeditate an Argument for proof of this opinion, which will not <hi>tremble in its arraignment at the barre of reaſon,</hi> unleſs ignorance or paſſion uſurpe the Bench; and this opinion is alſo ſeconded with the authority of divers Caſuiſts elſewhere cited, whereunto I adde the ſuffrage of a grave and learned Divine that tells us, <hi>Sinners are ſecret, not of publicke notice,

            <argument>
               <p>The ſufficiency of Scripture whereupon Negative Arguments are grounded. The Argument deduced from<hi> 1 Cor. 11.28. </hi>It is difficult and unſafe to judge of other mens eſtate. Of temerarious judgment, of judging men to be wicked or irregenerate. With what difficulty, and what a pedegree of conſequences their proofs are derived from Scripture. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rules, for ſatisfaction of doubting Conſciences, perſwade the contrary to their way. Of Chriſts admitting onely Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,<hi> Heb. 13.17. Matth. 18.16. Revel. 2.2. 1 Pet. 3.15. 1 Cor. 5.11. </hi>explained and vindicated.</p>
            </argument>
            <q>
               <p>THE <hi>Canon</hi> preſcribing and directing the due adminiſtration and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Sacrament, is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. We cannot with <hi>Tertullian</hi> adore the fullneſs of the Scripture, unleſs we yeeld it to be a perfect rule of faith and manners, which it cannot be, if it be deficient in any thing neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be done or beleeved, eſpecially in ſuch places, where it purpoſely handleth things of that concernment: <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect (&amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectum est, cui nil deest,)</hi> and <hi>it is able to make wiſe unto ſalvation, and thoroughly to furniſh the man of God.</hi> And therefore here, and onely here an
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:168423:78"/>Argument, <hi>ab authoritate negativè,</hi> holdeth good: But in that Chapter to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> I finde a precept, <hi>Let a man examine himſelf,</hi> none; that he ſhould neceſſarily paſs the examination of another; between the proper examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelf, and eating and drinking no other thing intervenes; <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat, (So)</hi> without more examination, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done ſo, he muſt not be letted; and therefore this very Commentary is made upon that Text by pathetical <hi>Chryſoſtome; He doth not bid one man to examine another, but every man himſelf, making the judgment private and without witneſſes. Paraeus</hi> ſtrikes in <hi>Uniſons</hi> with that ancient Father, <hi>The Apoſtle ſaith not, the Prieſt ſhall examine, or prove them, but every man himſelf.</hi> So doth <hi>Sarcerius, He commands not that one ſhould be approved to another, but each one to himſelf;</hi> as long before <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> accounted every mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to be his beſt director in this caſe. By what authority then can he be put back from the Sacrament, that hath examined himſelf? And to ſuſpect that any have not examined themſelves, who ſhall profeſs to have done ſo, (without a violent ſuſpicion, which is neer to a moral certainty of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) how can it be competible with Charity, <hi>that hopeth all things, beleeveth all things,</hi> and <hi>thinketh no evil?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being a ſtubborn hard bone, much adoe there is to overcome it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out drawing blood from the jaws; One ſets his teeth to it, and ſaith, That the precept of examining a mans ſelf, excludes not the examination of his Paſtor, or the Elders, or the Congregation, both may be conſiſtent, and both requiſite. But the offerture is ſupervacaneous, for the Argument concludes not; A man muſt examine himſelf: therefore the Miniſter, &amp;c. may not, or need not examine him; but we onely argue, that becauſe where the Apoſtle profeſſedly preſcribeth the preparative diſpoſitions and duties requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to worthy receiving, he not onely gives no expreſs precept that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, or Elders, or Congregation ſhall examine, nor the people ſubmit to examination, but rather the contrary, for having examined himſelf he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits himſelf ſo to eat, therefore it is not of the neceſſity of duty; for what the Scripture commands not, obligeth not; he permits a man to paſs from ſelf-examination, to receiving without any other thing intervening; <hi>Let him exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himſelf, and ſo let him eate,</hi> without any more adoe in reſpect of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which if it had been requiſite, the Apoſtle would as well have ſaid, Let him alſo paſs the examination of his Paſtor, &amp;c. as examine himſelf. And this Argument from the Authority negative of Scripture (though <hi>(bet him eate)</hi> affirms alſo the liberty of acceſs, without any other than ſelf-examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) is not onely efficacious in general concerning the neceſſity of things to be done or beleeved, but in this place, and upon this very account, is ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially approved by Interpreters, and urged as concluſive to the excluding the neceſſity of any other examination.</p>
               <p>Another tells us, that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were a Church lately planted, a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple newly called out of the world, and converted to the Faith, and therefore it was to be preſumed they were ſufficiently qualified both for knowledge and ſanctity, and needed no other but the proper examination of their own hearts. But I ſhall reply;</p>
               <p>Firſt, if they were newly converted, and ſo late begotten of the ſeed of the Word, they were then lefs grown in explicite knowledge, and leſs perfectly
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:168423:79"/>inſtructed in the myſteries of the Faith, and therefore did more need to be put under probation in the notion of the <hi>Catechumeni:</hi> but in truth the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> had been divers years planted, and the Apoſtles baptizing whole Families (Yonglings as well as aged, as other Texts warrant us to aſſert againſt the Anabaptiſts) in all probability, beſides the firſt Converts, there was now ſince the firſt conſtitution of that Church, a ſecond riſe and growth ſprung up to be adult and capable of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Rule of the Apoſtle is written for our inſtruction, catholique and extenſive to all times, places, and perſons, not limited or reſtrained to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and to confine and appropriate general precepts to ſpecial times, and particular perſons, is <hi>artificium haereticum,</hi> to expilate and exhauſt the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the Church, and imbezill the Weapons of the Faith, and tends to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat the ſtanding Forces of Scripture.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>ex conceſſo,</hi> this will then conſequently exempt from examination verbal or real, ſuch as may well be preſumed to be ſufficiently qualified, and ſo it is not of neceſſity, that the probation ſhould be general.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the whole Epiſtle ſheweth, how culpable thoſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> were; and how many were their errors in faith, and ſpots in manners; ſo that for ought I know, our Congregations generally (abſtracting them from theſe diſmal Hereſies which have lately ſpawn'd from, and been foſtered by men of like principles to thoſe we diſpute againſt, and which for ought I ſee, obſtruct no mans acceſs to the Sacrament, if his <hi>Seraphical</hi> Elevation can vouchſafe a condeſcenſion to Ordinances) are not more guilty or obnoxious. Even in this very concernment of their qualifications for the Communion, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20, 30. that many of them received unworthily, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned not the Lords body from common meat, and had taken too much drink before they came to partake of the myſtical Cup; Yet neither doth the Apoſtle command, nor encourage the intermiſſion of the Lords Supper, nor reprehend thoſe that were better qualified and conditioned, for commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating in a mixt Congregation, or among the Rout, (as they phraſe it, with ſomewhat too ſtrange a ſpice of the old Phariſee) as if it had been either a ſtain to their holineſs, or a pollution to their perſons, or an obſtacle to the fruit and efficacy of the Sacrament; neither doth he charge or caution the Elders thenceforth to admit no more without a pre-examination.</p>
               <p>Another thus anſwers, That this ſelf-examining is onely meant of that judging which prevents the judgment of God mentioned, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. which no mans examining of another can doe, but onely his examining of himſelf. But if this were granted, yet then it follows however, that no other but ſuch ſelf-examination is required by the Apoſtle, for he preſcribes no other but this, and that is as much as we contend for. But when that learned man tells us in the ſame place, that the Paſtors and Elders of <hi>Corinth</hi> had admitted ſome to the Lords Table, whom they judged fit and worthy Communicants, but God judged otherwiſe of them, it was no impudence nor preſumption in us to expect that he would have ſhewed us, where there is one ſyllable at leaſt that mentions the admiſſion onely of ſuch as were by them thought fit, or of any probation made of their fitneſs, that were not notorious and ſcandalous ſinners; and if ſelf-examination be ſufficient to prevent Gods judgement, it muſt be enough to prevent all ſinne, every ſinne being waited on by judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:168423:79"/>and conſequently to prevent a ſinful receiving, there needs none but a ſelf-examination.</p>
               <p>Another takes this bone in hand, and would cruſh and break it with this interpoſition, That to the right examination of a mans ſelf ſuch diſpoſitions and graces are requiſite, as no unconverted man is capable of; ſo as though upon ſelf-examination a man might be admitted, yet no man not having ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt ſigns of being in the ſtate of grace, can hereupon ground any title or claim to the Sacrament, as being not ſuſceptible of ſelf-examination. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I ſhall ſay (not to reflect that it carries a ſpice of <hi>Socinus,</hi> to hold that onely perſons converted are capable of the Sacraments) that it is a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſuitable to their principles, that they aſſume a power to judge the ſecret things of the heart, for it was wont to be an indubitable maxime, <hi>De occultis non judicat Eccleſia,</hi> and of that nature is the right diſcharge of the duty of ſelf-examination. They can pretend but to make judgment onely of externall actions, and ſuch as may give ſcandal and offence, thoſe they can take cognizance of, and they lye within a judicial Sphear, but the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſecret things of the heart, fall within none but a divine <hi>Horizon,</hi> and none can be ſcandalous onely for ſuch things, becauſe no others can take notice of them.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſtill retreat to my firſt Fortreſs, I reade, <hi>Let a man examine himſelf,</hi> not that any ſhould examine his examination: Nay poſitively I finde, that upon ſelf-examination he may ſo eat, which liberty cannot conſiſt with a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of having ſelf-examination examined by another. Men are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded not onely to examine themſelves, in order to receiving the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> but alſo generally to try their ways, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.4. and their works, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.4. and if unconverted men cannot doe this, they may upon like account bring them under examination for their whole life, &amp; give a new name to the ſame thing of auricular confeſſion: And if unconverted men cannot examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, how ſhall they know themſelves to be unfit and unworthy, that they may repent and better diſpoſe themſelves, and in the interim abſtain? Who gave them liberty or means to ſearch the heart, who are not proper Maſters to whom men muſt ſtand or fall?</p>
               <p>But they tell us, that there is a two-fold knowledge, <hi>Intuitive,</hi> which is by an immediate looking on, and <hi>Arguitive</hi> (or according to the more uſual Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtick term, <hi>Diſcurſive</hi>) which is by comparing one thing with another, and reaſoning from one thing to another; in the firſt way God onely knows the hearts of men; in the ſecond ſenſe, we may know the condition of mens hearts, by their outward actions, as a tree by his fruits. Whereunto I ſhall anſwer, that it muſt ſtill be reminded, what was premiſed in the ſtate of the queſtion, that I diſclaim and proteſt againſt the patrociny of perſons notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wicked and ſcandalous, no part of my Apology looks toward ſuch, but to ſtigmatize with this brand all thoſe whom they exclude from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and to exclude them upon that ſcore, is a calumny to the perſons, and a contumely to <hi>Sion,</hi> and will be matter of triumph to <hi>Gath</hi> and <hi>Askelon.</hi>

               <p>Subſequently to this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> I ſhall ſay, that when men of moral life, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebukable for thoſe crimes, which <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls <hi>graviora &amp; exitioſa;</hi> and others, <hi>vaſtantia conſcientiam,</hi> and whoſe knowledge of the Articles of the Faith, and Principles of Religion, cannot rationally be doubted of; yet ſuch cannot by favour of their opinion, be tranſlated into the <hi>Albe</hi> of perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted able to examine themſelves, I doubt, if ſuch a judgment ſmack not more of a reſult from <hi>entuitive,</hi> than diſcurſive knowledge.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I think a man may uſe and exerciſe this diſcurſive knowledge where there is no need, by a ſuperfluous indagation of things that appertain not to him, and he is then <hi>al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, though a man have been ſuppoſed formerly not to have been qualified and impowred to examine himſelf, yet who can judge whether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his approach to the Holy Table, in a ſenſe of the neceſſity of the duty of ſelf-examination, applying himſelf in ſome degree to the diſcharge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that ſpirit, which as the winde bloweth where it liſteth, ſo ſometimes comes ſuddenly, as a mighty ruſhing winde, may not inable him to the preſent effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual performance thereof?

               <p>Fourthly, the concluſion that a man is not able to examine himſelf, doth here preſuppoſe, and is inferred from another concluſion, that the perſon is a wicked unconverted man; but there is ſo much uncertainty in the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſo much danger in making the concluſion, that I think no charitable ſoul humbled by the fear of the Lord, will be very forward ſo to conclude, this being <hi>judicium figuli non luti, domini non conſervi.</hi> Though I will grant that for any great and ſcandalous ſin, being notorious, a man may be ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; yet I cannot yeeld that every ſuch ſcandal concludes a man irregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, nor can I al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And even a regenerate man is a mixt perſon, made up of the fleſh, as well as the ſpirit; he is as the twilight, where light and darkneſs are mixt and blended together; and though the path of the juſt be as the ſhining light, which ſhineth more and more till perfect day, yet till the ſecond riſe and coming of the Sunne of righteouſneſs, it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers ſome alloy of darkneſs. The fleſh and the ſpirit are ſtill at warre one with the other, and though ſometimes, and in ſome things, the one or the other prevail, yet the one never worketh without the renitency and reaction of the other; ſo that as the perſons, ſo the actions are mixed, and there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver an efficacious willing of the one, without a remiſſe volition of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry object; the act is voluntary, but the things are done, <hi>nolentèr, volentèr,</hi> and the act is more remiſſe through the mixture of what is involuntary,
<note place="margin">Rom. 7.15.</note> with what is voluntary in the precedent deliberation. And as the reluctancy of the fleſh, and the influence and working of Concupiſcence in all ſpiritual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and actions of juſt men, diſtils a ſinfulneſs into the ſame, and thereby ſtains, impairs, and extenuates them ſo far, as that though it prevail not to pervert the ſubſtance of juſt actions, yet it enfeebleth and impedeth them from attaining to that height and ſtrain of perfection, whereby they ſhould be able to juſtifie before God; ſo the retraction and reluctancy of the ſpirit in evil actions (where that ſpirit is, which none can know but he that feels, for who elſe knows the ſpirit of a man?) though it make them not ceaſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſins, nor can give them form; yet it remitteth and mitigateth the guilt, and gives them ſome qualification, ſo as ſuch men ſo offending, though they are not without ſpot unrebukable, yet theſe may be the ſpots of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and they may be good men that commit ſome evils.</p>
               <p>The quinteſſence to be limbeck'd and diſtilled from thoſe reſolutions is this, That it is as difficult to diſcern, and doubtful to judge of the ſtates of men, as dangerous to erre in ſuch judgment; it is a judgment never eaſie, nor always infallible, for the ſpirit of man which is in him, to judge of his eſtate, and more difficult and dangerous for another, that knows not the things of a man. In doubts that concern things, nothing but the weight of reaſon muſt turn the ſcale; but in doubts concerning perſons, the poyſe of Charity muſt incline the beam toward the better part, if not poſitively and ſpeculatively to eſteem them to be good, yet negatively and practically not to conclude them evil, but <hi>ad hîc &amp; nunc,</hi> to handle them, as if they were good. When we judge of things, the good or evil thereof is not attended, nor are they prejudiced, whatſoever we may chance to judge of them; but the good or evil of him that judgeth is looked after, as he ſhall make true or falſe judgment, Truth being the proper good of the Underſtanding, as Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is the Evil thereof;
<note place="margin">Aquin. 22. <hi>q.</hi> 60. <hi>ar.</hi> 4.</note> and therefore every one ought to endeavour to make true judgment of things: But in judging of men, the good or evill of him that is judged is principally reſpected, who is honoured, if eſteemed good; and vilified, if judged to be evil; and therefore we ought to take heed, that we judge him good, rather than evil, unleſs evident and morally certain
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:168423:82"/>reaſons perſwade the contrary. And as for him that ſo judgeth, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps falſly, that judgment is no evil to his intellect, as neither doth it pertain to the perfection thereof in it ſelf, to know the truth of all ſingular contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent things, but it rather belongeth to, and argueth good affection. It is ſafer therefore to offend by exceſſe of charity, than through defect, and I had rather erre ten times upon the ſcore of hope, than once upon the account of ſupercilious raſh judgment. It is a good rule of the School; <hi>In judicandis aliis, eorum bona certa, meliora; certa mala, minora; bona dubia, certa; dubia mala, nulla judicemus.</hi> They had need be pregnant, and vehement proofs, if not plain demonſtrations, that ſhall warrant one to judge another to be a wicked man, for if to doubt it (which is when the mind is pendulous, and ſuſpended in the middeſt, without inclining to either part) or to ſuſpect it (which is the concitation of the mind to an aſſent,) or to opine it (which is an aſſent, but wavering and infirm, and with fear of the contrary) upon light ſigns and arguments, be ſinful; much more is it fully and firmly to judge him to be ſuch; and they may alſo be light Arguments to judge him to be evil, which yet may be ſufficient to doubt, or ſuſpect, or opine him to be ſo, becauſe the former aſſent requires ſurer grounds, eſpecially when this judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt be a ſentence externally and juridically pronounced, as in this caſe it is or ought to be, when a man is thereby debarred the Sacrament. In doubtful things the ſafer part is to be choſen, but <hi>Tutius est reddere rationem propter charitatem, quàm crudelitatem,</hi> It is clearly more ſafe to judge men good, than to ſentence them to be evil; for to erre in the former, is no pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical moral error, nor injurious to any, but onely ſpeculative, and in things contingent an evil of no moment; but to offend in the latter, is a practicall error, through an inordination and inconformity of ſuch judgment with righteouſneſs, which is a greater evil to him that judgeth, as being a wrong done to another, and a robbing him of his proper goods, his good name being a <hi>depoſitum</hi> laid up in the mindes of other men <hi>(Honesta fama alterum patrimonium; &amp; fama pari paſſu cum vita ambulat)</hi> which he ought not to be deprived of, but upon reaſons very ſufficient in the eſtimation of Prudence; otherwiſe the forfeiture of reputation, being a puniſhment, he ſhall be puniſhed without cauſe, and without ſuch reaſons perſwading the aſſent, though the judgment perhaps may be materially true, yet it is formally falſe judgment; true in it ſelf, yet falſe in him that makes it. The Lawyers ſay, <hi>Jura ſunt promptiora ad abſolvendum, quàm ad condemnandum,</hi> and they adde, <hi>Cùm ſunt parium jura obſcura, reo favendum est potiùs quàm actori, &amp; qui ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicat, habet ſe, ut actor, proximus de quo judicatur, ut reus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have been the more copious upon this ſubject, becauſe what is ſaid of judging or opining men to be irregenerate, is applicable in ſome degree to a ſuppoſing them ignorant. Ignorance, when it is of thoſe things we are bound to know (which differenceth it from neſcience) and do neglect, becoming ſo a pravous diſpoſition, marcheth in the ſame rank, and with the ſame pace with ſinne, and a ſuſpicion thereof in like manner robbes men of their better treaſure, their fame depoſited in the breſts of men, and thoſe two coming under ſuſpicion, being the impulſives of examination, and obſtructives to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and the colours wherewith they paint the neceſſity of the one, and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:168423:83"/>the ſhadows whereby they ſet off the other at more diſtance.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, ſome would impoſe upon us, that though here in this 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. the Apoſtle preſcribe no other but ſelf-examination, yet that in other places, there is found that which may inforce a being examined by others. But firſt before we come to take a proſpect of the particular places alleaged, they all fall under this prejudice, and are thereby fruſtrated, that <hi>Verum vero non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariatur,</hi> and therefore the higheſt principles of revealed truth cannot check or claſh with themſelves; but if any other, ſave ſelf-examination, were preſcribed as requiſite antecedently to partaking the Lords Supper, it would contradict this permiſſion, that he that hath examined himſelf might ſo eat, <hi>(So)</hi> without other examination; and therefore, whereas they pretend that the ſilence of the Scripture here in this place, is ſupplyed by the voice of God ſounding it elſewhere; who can but doubt that ſuch ſound is like the muſick of the Spheares, rather imaginary, than real? Some Texts are indeed pretended for it, and Arguments drawn and formed out of them, but more in number, than in weight, which if with any importunity they ſhall impoſe upon the world, doubtleſs ſome will ſay of them, as ſome Interpreters think of the <hi>Jebuſites,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.6. that they manned their walls with the bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And ſince at beſt their proofs are onely Arguments of probability and of conveniency, and propoſitions propagated and deduced from the firſt principles of Scripture, by ſo many deſcents and generations, that it is hard to try whether they do truly come from that Stock, or not, and in ſome mean Parents by the way, there may be fallacies which may vitiate and baſtard them, I cannot apprehend how they can beget a certainty in the Conſcience, that without ſuch previous proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Sacrament ought not to be adminiſtied, at moſt they can onely cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a dubious conſcience whether it may or not, or an opining, that it ſhould not.

And as ſoon as any were diſcipled, that is, converted, they were without any ſtop to be baptized; and if Diſciples are to be taken in that latitude and equivocal notion, in order to the one Sacrament, it ſhall be ſtrange to think they ought to be conſtrued in any ſtricter or more limited ſenſe, in reference to the other.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Judas</hi> was one of thoſe Diſciples, one of thoſe Twelve that ſate down, yet had not thoſe graces, though neceſſary to conſtitute and qualifie a Diſciple.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it appears by the firſt of the <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. that very many admitted there to the Communion, had not theſe Qualifications eſſential to real Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>

               <p>The three favourite and palmary Texts, which as moſt commonly, ſo with moſt colour, are produced in proof of this Diſcipline, are that of <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.2.

               <p>Concerning the firſt, it can conclude nothing to this purpoſe, unleſſe by ſome new Art trochilike, they could draw it to be conſequent, that every tryal muſt be by examination of the perſons, and that every one approaching to the Lords Table is likely to be a falſe Apoſtle, and that falſe Apoſtles were onely or chiefly to be tryed antecedently to the Communion; or that becauſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, ſuch as <hi>Ehion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus</hi> (which are thought to be here meant) and the <hi>Nicholaitans,</hi> which are expreſly mentioned, ought to be tryed by their

The Apoſtle therefore commands the faithful to have anſwers prepared and premeditated, whereby they might refel the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of the Gentiles, and aſſert their hope of eternal glory to be moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and ſatisfie any that was deſirous to learn the Reaſons of ſuch Hope: this is the ſumme and exſtract of the Commentaries of <hi>Calvin, Paraeus, Eſtius,</hi> and <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> upon the place.

               <p>Secondly, if this giving an anſwer were properly meant of a profeſſion of Faith, when there is hope of him that asketh, when the glory of God is to be aſſerted, or the name of Chriſt to be confeſſed, as <hi>Bullinger</hi> extends it: yet what is all this to an anſwer upon examination antecedent to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? How is the neceſſity thereof more at that time than another, evinced out of this Text? If it be anſwered, That if we muſt be ready to give an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer at all times, much more before the Communion; truly I think he ſhall deſerve thanks, as for a largeſſe, or for a charientiſme, that ſhall grant the conſequence; but let it however be conceded, yet much more at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and onely at the Sacrament are things diſparate, and the neceſſity hereof is at no other time obtruded; but neither however comes this home to our iſſue, as not proving that unleſſe men will be thus ready to give an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, they may not be admitted to the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> nor the Sacrament at all be adminiſtred. They muſt be ſtrange Scrues and Wires that ſhall draw this concluſion from the Text; the Flock may be faulty in neglect of their duty, yet this cannot blanch with an excuſe the omiſſion of office in the Paſtor, and that may be requiſite <hi>neceſſitate praecepti,</hi> which is not ſo <hi>medii.</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, but let it be by Supererogation yeelded, that by this anſwer is meant an account of Faith and previouſly to the Synaxis, ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> why muſt every man be reſtrayned to the Paſtor and Elders; when <hi>Dydimus</hi> thought that the Governors of the Church were thoſe principally concerned to be ready to give the anſwer, not to receive it? why might not the Papiſts have aſmuch colour to prove auricular Confeſſion from that of St. <hi>Iames, cap.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 16. Confeſs your ſinnes one to another, as theſe men have to prove that every man muſt give an account of his Faith to his Paſtor and Elders out of this of <hi>Peter,</hi> Be ready to give an anſwer to every one? But as our Divines reply upon the Papiſts, that by that text in <hi>Iames,</hi> the Prieſts are aſwell bound to confeſs themſelves to the people, as they unto the Prieſts; ſo why may not I aſwell retort, that by this Scripture in <hi>Peter,</hi> the Paſtors and Elders are aſwell bound to ſubmit to the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of any of the people, as any of them unto theirs? I ſhall therefore conclude that I doubt they will never be ready to give an anſwer to any that asketh a reaſon of the hope that they have, that this Text ſhould make for their purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Now laſtly to that of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. (which is indeed the darling and Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion-Text of the ſeparation) I ſhall anſwer, that <hi>not to eat</hi> here, cannot be underſtood of eating at the Lords Table, for there is nothing in the Context to leade to that interpretation, no like Phraſe elſewhere in Scripture to warrant it, no ſufficient authority to back, nor other reaſon to evince it, ſave that it will ſerve the turn, and their hypotheſis <hi>to keep company, &amp; to eat</hi> cannot ſignifie to have Fellowſhip and to eat together at the Sacrament. The Apoſtle could not poſſibly be ſo miſtaken as to be ſuppoſed to forbid them not to Company &amp; eat with the Fornicators of this World at the Lords Table where they never came, nor need they have gone out of the World, if they had not gone thither with them: wherefore this is generally underſtood of eating common meat, not Sacramental; yet they that goe this way are divided into two paths, ſome take it as a conſequent of Excommunication, with men ſo cenſured not to eat; others underſtand it Symbolically, as it denotes familiar conſortſhip and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, which they are forbidden to have with ſuch Offenders; but neither of theſe wayes will it lead to their ends, nor conclude any thing ſubſervient to their purpoſe: for the Argument will be either <hi>Ignorantia elenchi;</hi> and is not pertinent to our queſtion, if the Text be to be underſtood of an inordinate brother judicially excommunicated; or elſe <hi>Fallacia conſequentis,</hi> (and it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not from eating together at common Tables to the not eating together at the Table of the Lord) if the words are meant of ordinary eating with an inordinate brother not yet juridically ſentenced. St. <hi>Auguſtine, Oecumenius, Aquinas,</hi> and divers others, with ſome very ancient Copies, ſet the word <hi>(Called)</hi> before Fornicator, not Brother, and reades thus, If any Brother be called a Fornicator; the Greek will bear both readings; but the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſay, that when <hi>nominatus idem valet quod appellatus,</hi> the Greek word com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſed is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>That nothing can be neceſſary about the practice of the Sacrament, which is not there expreſs'd, they ſee no reaſon to yeeld;</hi> but they ſhould have ſpoken more ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, if they had ſhewed reaſon why they ſhould deny; but though they fall ſhort of that, yet they go too farre another way, when they talk of no other thing neceſſary, which they ſhould limit to no other probation.</p>

               <p>But if they mean onely that ſome other tryal is elſewhere preſcribed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſelf-examination, though not here mentioned, and therefore neceſſary, becauſe by Divine Revelation commanded; as they do not bring it forth, nor point us where we may finde it, ſo I know they cannot finde it, (for Scripture being moſt perfect truth, cannot contradict it ſelf; and if ſome other probation were injoyned him that had examined himſelf, he could not <hi>(ſo)</hi> eat, which would check with St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s direction; and therefore if they have found ſuch a command, I doubt they read it with <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Bede</hi>'s Spectacles, wherewith they ſaw things that had no exiſtence, or elſe met with it in the Goſpel of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the Acts of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Tecla,</hi> the Epiſtle to the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> or the Acts of St. <hi>John,</hi> according to <hi>Cerinthus.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Here the Apoſtle mentions no tryal by others for two Reaſons; First, becauſe the</hi> Corinthians <hi>to whom he ſpeakes were newly admitted to Church-fellowſhip by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their Faith, and needed not to be called to this again; but in our Church true diſcipline hath been neglected, and many are unfit:</hi> I have formerly ſuperſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this anſwer, and ſhewed the impertinency thereof, and ſhall not <hi>actum agere:</hi> onely ſince they know that we cannot ſwallow what they offer without chewing it, they ſhould have brought ſome proof that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did make ſuch a profeſſion of their Faith, as they require in order to admiſſion to the Sacrament; for we finde cauſe to doubt, that there was no ſuch diſcipline pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in the firſt times, ſince when three thouſand were baptized in one day, and added to the Church, we cannot imagine it facible, that every one of them ſhould make ſuch an explicite verbal profeſſion as they require, and there could not ſure be ſuch an Evidence of the ability of all thoſe <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that they ſhould be all taken to be ſuch Diſciples, as they ſay are not to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but the profeſſion of their Faith is ſufficient.</p>
               <p>But ſince the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were ſo ignorant (not convinced of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) and ſo criminous, as the Epiſtle chargeth them to be, if yet upon ſelf-examination the Apoſtle permits them to communicate, that liberty cannot ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally be denyed to thoſe, who doubtleſs are not ſo culpable as they were. The Precept, <hi>Let a man examine himſelf,</hi> is univerſal and catholique; and why then ſhould the permiſſion to communicate upon ſelf-examination be peculiar onely to thoſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> at that time, and ſo to ſeparate what God by St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath joyned together? To reſtrain and limit Divine Rules to particular times or perſons, without cogent circumſtances, ſets open a deſperate way to evade the force of Arguments deduced from Scripture, and to betray or make brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the Fortreſs of Faith: and though the Apologiſts to eſcape out of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſont ſtrait <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, to ſerve a turn, take that way, yet when they have ſoberly re-minded themſelves, they will finde this path leads to a <hi>preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice;</hi> and that hence ſome may take the advantage and encouragement to tell them, that Excommunication was onely a temporary diſcipline, in joyned while the Church wanted a ſecular Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>If ſome in our Churches may be ſuſpected to be unfit, it may perchance be fit to bring them under tryal by examination; but why <hi>paucorum crimen</hi> ſhould
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:168423:88"/>be attended with <hi>paena in omnes,</hi> and the unfitneſs of ſome ſhould introduce a neceſſity of examining all, I am not acute enough to diſcern the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Apoſtle here eys Chriſts performances with his Diſciples, whom he needed not to examine, being known to him.</hi> We are fully reconciled to this aſſertion, that the Apoſtle reflected upon the actions of Chriſt as his pattern, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red onely what he had received of the Lord; but then it ſeems that neither in what he received, nor what he delivered, is any the leaſt hint of any other, ſave ſelf-examination:

               <p>If the Apoſtles needed not to be examined, becauſe known to Chriſt, then without examination mens fitneſs may be manifeſted, and ſuch as are known need no farther tryal; but if the Apologiſts would condeſcend to be as gently and familiarly converſant with their people, as Chriſt was with his Diſciples, perhaps they might have as much knowledge of them alſo, or infuſe ſo much knowledge into them, as to prevent and fore-ſtall examination. Yet according to their model, the Apoſtles howſoever ought to have made a publick profeſſion of their Faith, though they were not obnoxious to examination. And if they tell us in earneſt, that for example ſake thoſe whoſe knowledge is elevated above ſuſpicion, yet ought to ſubmit to examination, I hope they will yeeld there had been far more reaſon for our Saviour, whoſe practice was to be our pattern, and whoſe example was to paſs into a Law, to have examined his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, though he actively, or they paſſively, needed it not; yet becauſe we nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it, as a ſtanding influential example, ſince that being the firſt adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that kinde, was to be the rule &amp; meaſure of all to follow. And ſurely it is not eaſily imaginable, that where profeſſedly the Inſtitution is recorded by the Evangeliſts, and repeated by the Apoſtle, with directions for the fit reception of the Sacrament, that there being the proper ſeat of ſuch Doctrine, there ſhould be no one word of previous tryal, and that it ſhould elſe-where hang upon a long chain of conſequences; and by ſeveral diſtillations be extracted from ſuch places of Scripture, where is no mention at all of the Sacrament, or any preparation thereunto. The celebrious name of <hi>Zanchy</hi> is mentioned, not to reflect light, but to raiſe a cloud, for they neither produce his words, nor direct us, where we may take view of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If none of theſe Reaſons were of weight</hi> (as they cannot but ſenſe enough to diſtruſt, for ſure they will not turn thoſe very ſcales at <hi>Sedan,</hi> which <hi>Capellus</hi> tells us would break with the four hundreth part of a grain) yet <hi>why may not
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:168423:89"/>examination of Paſtors and Church Officers, ſtand with that of a mans ſelf, theſe being not contrary, but ſubordinate, and the Precept being not excluſive, Let a man examine,</hi> &amp;c? They are ſo accuſtomed to <hi>ignoratio elenchi,</hi> that it is paſſed into their nature; we doe not ſay thoſe two are ſo contrary as to be incompatible; nor argue, that becauſe one is injoyned, the other is excluded: but we reaſon thus, that the liberty of communicating onely upon ſelf-examination granted by St. <hi>Paul (ſo let him eat)</hi> cannot conſiſt with the neceſſity of paſſing firſt the tryal of another before admiſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Small hopes of his ſelf-examination, that cannot bear the friendly tryal of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,</hi> (it ſeems now without the Elders:) This is like, as to ſay, there is little hope he will prove a good or penitent Emperour, that with <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, will not wait three days barefoot in the acerbity of Winter-weather, at Pope <hi>Hildebrands</hi> gate, to be reſtored to the Communion of the Church.</p>

                  <hi>This ſelf-examination is meant onely of ſecret ſinnes, and ſincerity of graces, which men cannot ſee, and that their examination is for the ſatisfaction and honour of the Church, and is of that which may be known and judged.</hi> However, they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine or limit the examination here commanded; yet no other beſides this falls under the command, and their limitation is grounded onely on their voluntary aſſertion, which limits not our judgment; and this ſelf-examination is not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily of ſinne, but faith, whereof knowledge is an integral part, <hi>Examine your ſelves whether you be in the Faith,</hi>

But they ſay <hi>Paraeus</hi> ſpeaks this:</p>

               <p n="2">2. Of <hi>Auricular</hi> Confeſſion.</p>

               </p>
               <p>To the firſt, though the <hi>Libertines</hi> boaſt, that what is ſinne in others, is not in them; and the Popiſh <hi>Canoniſts</hi> tell us, that though it may be a wanton and impudicous act in another to kiſs a woman, yet a Prieſt doing it, it is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed he doth it onely to bleſs her; yet we think it abominable to have ſuch divers Weights, and divers Meaſures; and therefore cannot denominate good and evil with reſpect of perſons, nor conceive that what is not juſt or warranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Popiſh Prieſts, ſhould yet be ſo in the Apologiſts; and if a man after ſelf-examination may ſo communicate without further probation by a Popiſh Prieſt, we have not light enough (unleſs they reflect it) to ſee, why he may not do ſo too without more tryal by any other Miniſter.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond, If he that hath examined himſelf may ſo receive, that <hi>(So)</hi> is excluſive of any farther examination, as well as of confeſſion; and though <hi>Paraeus</hi> alleage and apply the Argument, to refute the neceſſity of confeſſion, which he pertinently ſaith, <hi>ad hanc probationem olim inſtituta fuit,</hi> and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is ſpecially againſt that; yet the <hi>medium</hi> is general and extenſive, and applyable to all of the like kinde <hi>(univerſaliter applicandum, quod particulariter dictum.)</hi> And by the <hi>analogy</hi> and proportion of reaſon, it may as effectually be urged, and accommodated to fruſtrate the neceſſity of their pre-examination, ſince all the particulars are involved in, and may be collected out of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; and out of one principle may ſeveral concluſions be extracted and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to divers ſubjects. And whatſoever plauſible reaſons, or ſpecious preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they can muſter, to elude the force and energy of this Argument; and notwithſtanding the liberty granted by the Apoſtle, to maintain their proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as neceſſary, the ſame or the like, doe and may the Papiſts muſter, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the neceſsity of confeſsion.</p>

               <p>To the third, <hi>Paraeus</hi> indeed owns the words they cite, and the Paper runs not diſcord with them, which diſallows not, but ſuppoſeth pre-examination may be requiſite, as an act of prudence, <hi>ad hic &amp; nunc,</hi> in order to particular perſons who may rationally be ſuſpected to be of incompetent knowledge, but not as an univerſal and unlimited Empire over all, with power to make re-ſearch of their lives, and the ſignes of ſaving grace in them, as well as diſquiſition of their knowledge and intellectual gifts. <hi>Paraeus</hi> hath no ſpice that reliſheth of this, and if his ſenſe were not, as we have interpreted, we muſt <hi>doſiderare Paraeum in Paraeo,</hi> and the weapon he hath ſharpned againſt the Papiſts, would be turned upon himſelf; for if he think it required of the Miniſter, to make probation of all, how can it hold coherence with that which he ſaith, <hi>Eſt<expan>

As the Arguments rallied for their probation, are to my ſenſe (and I hope to make it evident to others) as looſe and wanton, as thoſe the Papiſts arrang for Confeſſions, and ſome of them are the ſame (as
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:168423:91"/>that of making judgment of, and ſhutting up the Leper) and theirs of <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhapha's</hi> Porters, weighs juſt as much as that of the Papiſts, concerning God's asking <hi>Cain</hi> where his brother was; ſo <hi>auricular</hi> Confeſsion hath as ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Reformation, and Godlineſs to uſher and attend it, as they can pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate their examination with, (which is oftentimes, if not always, <hi>auricular</hi> too, and acted by themſelves alone in private) as beſides the diſpoſing for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that it muſt needs give a bridle to ſinne, and a ſtirrop to holineſs and perfection, when a man takes ſo frequent a ſurvey of his actions and paſsions, cenſuring them with grief, confeſſing with ſhame, curing by counſel, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piating with puniſhment, and redeeming with reſolution to offend no more.</p>
               <p>Confeſſion was firſt onely publick recognition for publick ſcandals, and then inlarged and extended to private ſins, but voluntarily undertaken, not impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, of <hi>Conſilium Eccleſiasticum,</hi> it becaine at length <hi>Praeceptum Eccleſiae,</hi> then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned for all ſins <hi>quoad ſubſtantiam,</hi> at length <hi>quoad circumstantias,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion, as <hi>Luther</hi> calls it, degenerated into <hi>carnificinam cruentiſſimam conſcientia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum;</hi> and this was that <hi>priſca ſervitus</hi> whereunto <hi>Muſculus</hi> feared this exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was like to reduce us. The Keys at length got new Wards, and inſtead of opening Conſciences were uſed to unlock Cabinets and Kingdoms, and they that carryed them, hereby became Maſters of the houſe, and kept all men under their girdle by the keys that hung at it.</p>
               <p>The Presbyterians profeſs they examine none but children; but ſome of ours of that notion, ſpread and dilated their examination to all, though adult in knowledge, as well as years.</p>
               <p>The Independents enlarge and extend this tryal to their lives and gracious converſation, not onely to exclude them for the ſcandal of notorious ſins,
<note place="margin">Bayley <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſ. c.</hi> 7.</note> but not to admit them without approved ſigns of Holineſs, and to reject them not onely <hi>ob evidentiam juris aut facti,</hi> but upon ſuſpicion.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, that which was at firſt onely commended, as adjumental to Godlineſs, is now become, as it were, the form thereof, giving the name and eſſence thereunto; for let a man walk harmleſs and blameleſs without rebuke, yet if he walk not with them in this way, he is but a morral man onely, and hath not yet commenced religious, as if it might be ſaid of this diſcipline, as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> ſpeaks of diſcretion, <hi>tolle hanc &amp; virtus vitium erit,</hi> and an inconformity thereunto, were like the ſlaying of <hi>Calliſthenes</hi> to <hi>Alexander,</hi> a blaſting of all graces, or an alloy to all endowments.</p>
               <p>But nevertheleſs this new Light makes all to ſhine that walk in it, like the bright light of the Sunne, which gilds all his ſpots, and makes them inviſible, which ſome by their Proſpectives diſcern in the body thereof. What farther riſe it may have, or progreſsion make, we cannot certainly fore-tell, but may ſolicitouſly fear, ſince men of theſe principles are like the Crocodile, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ceaſeth growing, while he lives; ſo doe they ſtill increaſe in new ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and humours, and pretended diſcoveries; yet I hope they will alſo be as ſagacious as the Crocodiles of <hi>Nilus,</hi> who never hatch any thing, but they lay it without danger of being hurt by the riſing flood: yet in the interim, an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry judgment may eaſily diſcover, that a Fortreſs founded in the Conſcience, and raiſed on the advantage ground to command our reputation may keep all the parts adjacent in ſubjection, and bring them under contribution.</p>

               <p>In theſe Primitive Times, I finde that mutual reconciliations, and in the <hi>African</hi> Churches, <hi>Vigils</hi> or watchings in Prayers, and in <hi>Chryſoſtome's</hi> time, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings, and ſometimes, and in ſome places the publick renouncing of ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Hereſies, were antecedent to the <hi>Synaxis;</hi> but I meet with no Records of any command or example of previous probations as neceſſary, ſave for <hi>Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's.</hi>

When the Church that ſaw the benefit of publike Confeſſions for publick Offences, redounded as well to the ſubduing of the ſtubborneſs of their hard hearts, and the improving of their deeper humiliation, as to their raiſing up again by thoſe ſenſible comforts, which they received by the publick prayers
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:168423:93"/>of the Church and uſe of the keyes; ſome men reflecting hereupon, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their own Conſciences ſmarting for like offences, which being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly carried, were not obnoxious to the cenſures of the Church; to the end, they might obtain the like conſolation and quiet of minde, did voluntarily ſubmit themſelves to the Churches diſcipline herein, and underwent the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of publick confeſſion and penance. And to the end this publication of ſecret offences might be performed in the beſt way and diſcreeteſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſome prudent Miniſter was firſt acquainted therewith, by whoſe direction the Delinquent might underſtand what ſins were fit to be brought to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like notice of the Church, and in what manner the pennance was to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by them. At firſt it was left free to the penitent, to chuſe his Ghoſtly Father; but at length, by general conſent of the Biſhops, it was ordained, that in every Church one diſcreet Miniſter ſhould be appointed to receive Confeſsions, untill at length in the time of <hi>Nectarius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> (who dyed, <hi>A.D.</hi> 401.) upon occaſion of the infamy drawn upon the Clergy by the confeſſion of a Gentlewoman,

But ſeeing Faith and Repentance are as neceſſary, as knowledge, to worthy receiving, and as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal a part of that, whereof every one ought to make examination of himſelf, or others are to make of him, I wiſh it might be adviſedly perpended, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be not as great reaſon, to have <hi>auricular</hi> confeſsion in ſome rectified and qualified manner, and to impoſe it as neceſſary, in order to the communion, as to introduce their particular examination, as a duty ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, eſpecially ſince the <hi>Lutherans</hi> aſſert and practiſe it upon <hi>Homogeneal</hi> or like principles, as preparatory and antecedent to the Sacrament <hi>contra</hi>

               <p>But in the interim, the Argument remains unſhaken; If repentance be as neceſſary a qualification to receiving, and as eſſential a part of examination as knowledge, then there is in order to communicating no leſs reaſon to introduce the diſcipline of confeſſion, than of examination; if the one be ſet up, the other muſt alſo be impoſed; if the one may be omitted, the other may be laid aſide; if the one be but profitable to ſome, the other is not neceſſary to all: theſe two being like the ſubceleſtial <hi>Gemini,</hi> which appear ominouſly and unluckily, the one without the other.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Proſtrati,</hi> or <hi>ſuccumbentes,</hi> who were admitted to a place behind the Pulpit, or behind the Quire of the Church, called <hi>Catechumenium,</hi> (for there the <hi>Catechumens</hi> ſtood alſo) who were permitted there to kneel, &amp; pray amongſt the <hi>Catechumens;</hi> but (as ſome ſuppoſe) were permitted onely their own prayers, not thoſe of the <hi>Catechumens,</hi> and they went out with the <hi>Catechumens,</hi> or (as ſome think) after them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Stantes,</hi> who I conceive were alſo called <hi>initiati,</hi> who were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to joyn in all Ordinances with the Congregation, ſave the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> which ſtanding by, they might onely behold others (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Conſummati,</hi> as they were called, anſwerable to the <hi>Epoptae</hi> among the old Heathens) to receive, but themſelves might not partake; nor beſide were they permitted to bring their oblations, nor participate of what was offered and bleſſed (which ſome have miſtaken for the <hi>Eucharist</hi>) neither had they the kiſs of peace. Theſe two laſt ſteps the Apologiſts tread over, and the ſecond they divide into two, as little caring to underſtand the ancient diſcipline, as to model their own in conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereunto.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They do truly obſerve, and we think it very obſervable, <hi>that ſuch a courſe the ancient Church took about admitting Penitents</hi> (and therefore <hi>Albaspinus</hi> tells us, <hi>poenitentiam quaſi ad quendam catechumenatum repraeſentandum inſtitutum eſſe</hi>) and from thence ſhall re-minde them, that thoſe ſeveral degrees were onely ſuch as whereby Penitents were re-admitted, not whereunto they were directly and immediatly cenſured; but having been firſt excommunicate in order to their reſtoring to the Communion of the Church, they had the favour of being admitted by theſe ſeveral ſteps of penance, and none were <hi>Penitents,</hi> that had not been firſt excommunicate, which is diametrally oppoſite to their way of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſion, whereby men are immediately and only made <hi>ſtantes,</hi> that were never excommunicated, nor paſſed the other degrees of penance.</p>

               <p>Next, they take hold of what the Paper grants, <hi>that the Primitive Church ſaw the uſe of publick confeſſion;</hi> it did ſo; but it alſo ſaw the abuſe, and thereupon aboliſhed what had been formerly introduced; <hi>but that was done, they ſay, after the abuſe appeared, whereas now they ſay men ſweat at the ſight of the ſaddle, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bridle, to curb their luſts.</hi> The confuſion and abuſe of their way is as appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and therefore conſequently it is to be laid down,

               <p>Their examination, they ſay, <hi>is little more than publick confeſſion;</hi> I think upon examination they ought to make confeſſion of a palpable error, who igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly or wilfully miſtake confeſſion of ſins (which the Paper ſaith, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients ſaw the uſe of) for confeſſion of faith; the admitting ſome of their members onely upon publick confeſſion of faith, we have formerly traverſed.

               <p>It is for the honour of Antiquity, that as all the different ſorts of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers at <hi>Athens</hi> pretended to follow <hi>Socrates,</hi> ſo the new coyns of doctrine and diſcipline would ſeem to bear the ancient ſtamp; the Apologiſts, that have much nibled at, and detracted from Antiquity, would yet give their diſcipline for its better paſs, a Teſtimonial from the ancient Church. They formerly bid us to remember the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> and we cannot forget them, while their like pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice keeps up and refreſheth the memory of them, by ſuch a counterfeit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Antiquity, but rather it is the misfortune of this age, that their myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ſo long hidden, were now firſt publiſhed, which hath been like the opening of the Cheſt in the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> that <hi>Rhodiginus</hi> ſpeaks of, or the breaking

               <p>The Antients removed ſome few from the Communion, and thoſe onely by judicial ſentence; for the ſcandal of ſome nefariouſneſs, either evident, conieſt, or proved by Witneſs; whereas theſe ſuſpend at once their whole Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as if they were guilty of one common Apoſtaſie, not judicially, but arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily; not for notorious crimes, but upon ſuſpicions; and admit none of them, till they have approved themſelves to their good opinions, by demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſigns of holineſs; and till they doe ſo, they ſeparate from all Communion in this Ordinance with them, (which ſuſpending firſt, and then making tryall and probation afterwards, methinks holds ſome reſemblance with <hi>Lidford</hi> Law, whereof in our Countrey they ſay <hi>proverbially,</hi> That they bang and draw in the morning, and ſit in Judgment in the afternoon;) ſo as therefore, though we ſhould be unhappily obſtructed and retrenched from the like diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, as the ancient exerciſed (which is our great ſorrow, and not a little their fault (as I have ſhewed) who ſeem like an hard-galloping hot-ſpur, that asked if he might attain ſuch a place before night, and it was anſwered, Yes, if he rid ſofter) yet farther to excite others to a compliance with their way, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of inconformity to it, and pretend it little varieth from the ancient, they have therein as much of reaſon, as the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> had to pretend the <hi>Turks</hi> deſcended from the ancient <hi>Trojans,</hi> and thereupon to invite the <hi>Italians</hi> to aſſiſt them in the wars againſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the Enemies of that Nation, from whence they had one common <hi>origine.

Of the corruptions of this Church we have formerly conſidered, and ſhewed thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions ought not to be the Generation of their Separation, which though they call a gathering of Churches, yet by a denomination taken from the major part, may be rather called a diſſipating, or a gathering onely of Ears, and ſcattering of Sheaves, to be ſnatch'd up for ſome other ſtrange Barn. And be the Church diſtempered by corruptions, yet we ſhall be more glad to ſee the Cure undertaken in the way of the old approved <hi>Methodiſts,</hi> or <hi>Dogmatiſts,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than of <hi>Empericks,</hi> (who are all for the knife,) for we fear thoſe new Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians that practiſe onely on a new Church, muſt according to the <hi>German</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, have a new Church-yard.</p>
               <p>To ſhew what <hi>Spirit the beſt of the Ancients were of in this matter,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe the teſtimony of <hi>Albaspinaeus</hi> (as they of late call him, though in the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Editions of his Works, he be named <hi>Albaspinus</hi>) viz. <hi>They thought it dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable to God and Man, not onely for them that were defiled with leſſer ſinnes; but if under a Cloud of ſuspicion, to come to the</hi> Euchariſt, <hi>and judge it dangerous for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved Penitents to touch thoſe things, if not thought holy enough by them, to whom
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:168423:101"/>the care of the Sacrament was committed.</hi> Next, they cite <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> who, ſay they, <hi>is as full as can be wiſhed</hi> (whom therefore they <hi>wonder ſhould be brought in for this ſuggeſted liberty) he admoniſhing Miniſters not to deliver the</hi> Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt <hi>to the unworthy; though he wear the Crown, thou haſt greater authority than he, no ſmall puniſhment hangs over our heads, if we ſuffer any to come that we know to live in any ſinne, not ſaying, If he will not ſubmit to tryal, you have freed your ſoul, if you exhort; but ſaith, his blood will be required of thy hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe being the onely ſtakes in their hedge, cut out of the Forreſt of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, we ſhall more diligently examine their ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Firſt, concerning <hi>Albaspinus,</hi> I muſt re-minde them, that he ſpeaks this of ſuch as had been firſt excommunicate for ſome ſcandalous offence, and then were put under penance in order to their reſtoring; for he delivers it in anſwer to the queſtion, Why after the firſt three degrees of penance, the fourth was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed? ſo as this will be <hi>extra aleas,</hi> in reſpect to any defence of their way, who diſcommon men from the Sacrament, that were never thus cenſured for any ſcandalous crime.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they ſhew a reſpect more partial to their Cauſe, than juſt to their Reader, by impoſing on him in the Tranſlation; for <hi>leviſſimâ maculâ inquina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> is not, <hi>defiled with leſſer ſinnes,</hi> but <hi>with the leaſt,</hi> or <hi>lighteſt ſtain, viz.</hi> of their former ſins (which in all likelyhood were great:) for thoſe ſtaines the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients thought to be purged and expiated by penal acts (not the offence, as an offence to God, or the puniſhment due to ſin, which are oppoſed to juſtification, but only the ſpot conſiſting in an habitual pravity, &amp; oppoſed chiefly to juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation) and repentance and ſorrow to be inſtrumental cauſes,

               <p>Secondly, <hi>Maculae nebulâ offuſum,</hi> is but the ſame thing in <hi>Hyperbole;</hi> and though it ſhould properly be rendred <hi>a Cloud of ſtain,</hi> and virtually may ſignifie a ſuſpicion of a ſtain, (not as they would have it <hi>a cloud of ſuspicion</hi> for leſſer ſins) notwithſtanding leſt <hi>Nebula</hi> ſo interpreted, ſhould prove (as it alſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth) a Road-net to catch Woodcocks, and might ſeem to give ſome confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to what they practiſe in ſuſpending men, becauſe they ſuſpect their lives; it muſt alſo be known, that this was onely a ſuſpicion of one that having once been duly convicted to have fallen, might be doubted not to be perfectly recovered; and the Law determines, <hi>Semel malus ſemper praeſumitur eſſe malus, in eodem genere mali,</hi> and there is great difference in the reaſon of delaying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuſpicion the reſtitution of one that hath notoriouſly ſinned, and ſuſpending one onely upon ſuſpicion of ſinne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Thoſe abſolved Penitents, were abſolved onely of three degrees of penance; not the fourth, as is evident by the Context, and the Ancients thought a reconciliation or reſtitution, <hi>per ſaltum,</hi> to be the reſtoring of a man not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cleanſed, but of one bringing back his ſpots upon him; this is that which <hi>Cyprian</hi> complains of, that when <hi>nondum reſtitutâ Eccleſiae pace, ad communicatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem admittuntur, &amp; offertur nomen eorum, &amp; nondum poenitentiâ factâ,

               <p>Fourthly, The Impoſture is more groſs when <hi>quod non ſatìs ſancti &amp; ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficati cenſebantur, quibus tanta res committeretur,</hi> is thus tranſlated, <hi>That they were not thought holy enough by them, to whom the care of the Sacrament was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted;</hi> whereas it rightly ſhould be rendred, <hi>Not holy enough to whom ſo great a thing ſhould be delivered.</hi> And whereto their changing of the words and ſenſe doth tend, may be pertinently remembred, when we come to examine, whether their way ſmack of <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> it being onely <hi>regni causâ,</hi> for which it ſeemes <hi>jusjurandum violandum eſt;</hi> whether the Apologiſts themſelves peruſed this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, or it were a quotation lent them, we know not; but I now finde it requiſite that we ſhould peruſe thoſe which they quote.</p>
               <p>But for <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> whoſe words might have been long enough ſought for, by their quotation of the 38. <hi>Homily</hi> on <hi>Matthew,</hi> (which though I am eaſie to excuſe as a Pen-lapſe, (whereof in this kinde they have many,) yet it ſeems not ſuch by a ſecond referring us for them to the ſame place; but however we know he owns them, and delivers them in the 83. <hi>Homil.</hi> on the 26. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and ſome of them elſe-where alſo.)

Whether there be reaſon to examine diſpoſitively to hearing the Word, aſwell as to receiving the Sacrament, and danger to the Unworthy in the one, aſwell as in the other? The caſting of Pearl before Swine, and giving holy things unto Dogs, what it intends? The difference between the Word and Sacraments. All not anciently admitted to all the Word. The Sacrament multifariouſly proved to be a converting Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and this to be the common judgment of<hi> Proteſtants. </hi>What effects may be hoped onely by ſeeing the Adminiſtration, without partaking?

               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe then were dark times, unleſs they were holier than ours,</hi> that is, they were dark, unleſs they had more light, they were holier doubtleſs, becauſe more humble, and more meek, and more charitable; but ſome men are like the <hi>Hermit,</hi> who thought the Sun ſhined onely into his Cell, and reſemble <hi>Seneca</hi>'s <hi>Harpaste,</hi> who thought the rooms to be dark, when her ſelf was become blinde.</p>
               <p>They tell us, <hi>a ſaying of a godly man, That all to the Sacrament is the great</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias <hi>of thoſe days, with whom the little</hi> Davids <hi>of this age are encountring;</hi> and I ſhall requite them with an <hi>Apothegm</hi> of a man, that perchance can be no godly man, becauſe not of their judgment, That none to the Sacrament, but whom they pleaſe, is the great <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> for which all the Silver-ſmiths of the times are making Shrines, as if the Image fell down from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> when it was made by the Crafts-men.</p>

                  <hi>The testimony that allows no cauſe of ſeparation from the communion, but ſuch ſins, as deſerve excommunication, they ſay, bears no weight;</hi> yet it is alleged out of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> but <hi>Auguſtinus tecum erravit,</hi> as <hi>Corvicius.</hi> The truth is, St.

                  <hi>Auguſtine</hi> reciting and allowing therein the ſenſe and judgment of ſome pious men in his age, ſpeaks this of an active ſeparation of a mans ſelf upon conſcience of his ſinfulneſs, and not of a paſſive, as it is commonly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by <hi>Gratian</hi> and others; but the argument holds with more nerves and energy againſt a paſſive ſeparation, ſince a greater cauſe is requiſite to exclude thoſe that do come, than to deterr them from coming, and many may not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance lawfully approach, which yet cannot but unlawfully be repelled, as I have ſaid before.</p>
               <p>And if the ancient Church excluded none but ſuch as were or had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, we may be indulged to think no ſins a cauſe of ſeparation from the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> but ſuch as merit excommunication. I confeſs, my <hi>Horizon</hi> is very narrow, (as men that are of no heighth, have no large proſpect) and mine eyes are weak, and do not diſcern all that I might, and my memory as frail to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all thoſe <hi>ſpecies</hi> and notions, which ſometime perchance I have received; but ſure I did never meet with (or have forgotten) any clear evidence in anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, that warranted the diſtinction between Excommunication and Suſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as now it is apprehended and practiſed, or that any were excluded from the

               <p>The Apologiſt tells us indeed, that Antiquity hath diſtinguiſhed between Excommunication and Suſpenſion, but they verifie it by no evidence, or teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, ſave their own, and we ſhould adviſe them, rather to imitate <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his Scholars in their ſilence, than to emulate their Maſter in his <hi>Ipſe dixit.</hi> Their Margin ſeems to quote <hi>Ames,</hi> as aſſerting what they affirm, but though that learned man diſtinguiſh in the place cited, between the greater and the leſſer Excommunication,

The others ſuffered excluſion for natural diſabilities, we are ſpeaking now of thoſe that were ſeparate for ſins, which are moral defects, and among thoſe, though the Paper diſtinguiſh Penitents from Excommunicate, it was not becauſe all thoſe under penance, had not alſo been excommunicated, but becauſe all excommunicate were not Penitents, theſe later being (as I ſaid before) <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munionis eccleſiaſticae candidati;</hi> it was conceded them as a favour to do pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, in order to their redintegration, which to the others was not as yet vouchſafed.</p>
               <p>But however the Apologiſts (like the Oſtrich leave their Eggs in the duſt, that any foot may cruſh them, and ſo) have deſerted all incubation upon ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſion, yet I am not ignorant that ſome others have engaged in a vindication of the practice and exerciſe thereof, in the primitive times; but however their ſheets like that of <hi>Parrhaſius,</hi> may ſeem real to other Painters, yet they are but painted.</p>
               <p>They ſhew us, 1. <hi>That divers ſorts of men were not admitted to the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist, which were not under excommunication.</hi> And we grant it, but we ask, if it neceſſarily follow that they muſt be perſons ſuſpended, that is,

                  <hi>Facilior fuiſſet hic locus ſi nemo eum expoſuiſſet;</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance we might have been more facile to beleeve that there might have been ſome evidence for Suſpenſion in Antiquity, if thoſe that have ſo confidently aſſumed to prove it, had not fallen ſo ſhort of their undertakings, and our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation; who as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaid of <hi>Baronius,</hi> that he did <hi>Annales facere, non ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere;</hi> ſo they have rather made than found their proofs, and have rather impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon, than informed us, ſo that we may not know, unleſs we ſhall continue ignorant.</p>
               <p>But having cleared theſe miſts, let us look what purer light can be reflected upon us from the Monuments of the ancient Church, that we may ſee to trace their foot-ſteps, and diſcern what way they walked.

And had the Church in his time known any ſuch Cenſure (eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inflicted for want of a viſible worthineſs) he could never have ſaid, as is pre-alleaged, <hi>Si peccata tanta non ſunt ut excommunicandus quiſquam homo judice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, non debet ſe à quotidiana medicina Dominici corporis ſeparare;</hi> or had it been denizon'd in <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>'s age, he would not have ſaid, that thoſe which were unworthy to partake of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> were likewiſe unworthy to joyn in the Prayers and Hymnes.</p>
               <p>But as <hi>Alexander</hi> ſcorned to ſteal a Victory in the night, but would get it in clear day, ſo we ſhall hide nothing that we can bring to light, which may be of advantage to their cauſe, though it ſeem to have been in the dark to all thoſe which I have met with, that have defended it, who have ſaid leſs for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, than might be ſaid for them, and are therefore obnoxious to <hi>David</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepation, who when they take themſelves to be valiant men, and who is like them in <hi>Iſrael?</hi> yet have not kept their Lord ſo, but that any one of the people may come to deſtroy him.

               <p>To deal ingenuouſly, as the Canons of the ancient Councels will lend the beſt Proſpect of the Diſcipline of the Church, thoſe being the Mould wherein that was caſt; ſo we ſhall acknowledge, that in thoſe Canons we ſometimes meet with the notion of Suſpenſion, like as we doe with thoſe of <hi>Retentus, Sequt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus, Remotus, Segregatus, Excluſus,</hi> all of them <hi>Synonymous,</hi> and all to be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and defined by the <hi>terminus à quo,</hi> that from which was the Separation:
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:168423:111"/>But I doe with ſome confidence aſſert, that <hi>ſuſpended</hi> is there taken in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, not the modern appropriate notion, ſignifying a deferring of, or detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from; and that not onely this one Ordinance of the Lords Supper, but all Ordinances; and is, in effect, but Excommunication, carrying onely beſides a connotation of a future reſtitution to Communion, after penance done, or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction given. The ſame words have not always the ſame ſenſe in all Ages, nor ſignifie the ſame things, elſe we might conclude the Aſſemblies of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to be Churches, and their Clerks of the Market to be Biſhops; and to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that the term Suſpenſion is found in ancient Records; therefore there was ſuch a thing, as uſe hath ſince made the word to import, carries as much reaſon as the Papiſts have to conclude, that becauſe prayer for the dead was uſed in the ancient Church, therefore it related to Purgatory; or is with as much ſenſe as <hi>Valderama</hi> proves the order of <hi>Jeſuites</hi> out of Scripture, becauſe it is there ſaid, that God hath called us to the ſociety of his Son Jeſus. But that Suſpenſion in the old Canons implies not a deferring of, or detaining from the <hi>Eucharist</hi> onely and immediately, but a with-holding from all Eccleſiaſtical Communion, is very clear and evident, becauſe it is always ſaid to be;</p>

               <p>For 1. The Schools allow no power to deny the Sacrament publickly to thoſe that in the proper judgment of the Miniſter are unworthy, but this power they aſſume, withholding it from ſuch as were never duly cenſured by any other Judicatory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The School warrants a publick denial unto none but notorious ſinners, but they keep back the Sacrament from all that do not upon triall approve themſelves Saints, and though they pretend to hold, that none are rightfully to be excluded, but ſuch as are ſome way ſcandalous, yet actually they withhold the Communion from thoſe that they dare not ſay, much leſs have they been ſentenced to be ſcandalous, and are therefore more inexcuſably culpable, to be like <hi>Medea,</hi> To ſee and approve better things and do worſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The School preſcribes the Sacrament to be exhibited to ſecret ſinners, if they publickly crave it, that is, ſuch whoſe ſins though known to ſome few, and among thoſe to the Miniſter, yet are not notorious; but they to prevent the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual craving by their approach, and offering themſelves, (like <hi>Julian</hi> who ſtruck at Chriſtianity rather than Chriſtians, ſo) they have excommunicated the Sacrament it ſelf out of their proper Congregations, that none might come to demand it, and thoſe that have come to them to require it, have been denied the participation, though ſuch as have not been patible of the definition of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious ſinners; and though they ſuppoſe that it proves nothing, that the Schoolmen and Caſuiſts aſſert, that ſecret ſinners are not to be kept off, yet it proves their courſe not paralel with the line drawn out by the School, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it to thoſe, the far greateſt part whereof can be but occult ſinners, and not within the definition of notorious; and it is ſomething ſure, that hereby the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:168423:114"/>School and Caſuiſts muſt conſequently conclude, that when a Miniſter doth (as he ought) diſtribute the Sacrament to him whom onely by his private no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice he knows unworthy, he doth no act ſimply unlawfull, by partaking of the receivers ſin, or proſtituting the privileges of the godly, or giving falſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, nor that he is to ſuſpend him, untill he hath rendred, upon triall, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative ſigns of his converſion.</p>
               <p>They ſay, <hi>Suarez</hi> tells us, <hi>That a violent ſuspicion is enough to deny the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> but (as <hi>Pliny</hi> writes of the deceitfulneſs of the <hi>Panther</hi>) they ſhew forth thoſe parts which ſeem fair for them, and hide the head, which would ſeem ſtern and terrible; ſo <hi>Suarez</hi> indeed ſaith this of a publick ſuſpition, not of any private, and of ſuch a violent ſuſpition too, <hi>quae probabili rationi deponi non poteſt,</hi> for if it be onely probable ſuſpicion,

               <p>If the hope of learning and poſſibility of attaining faith, may ſupport and warrant a promiſcuous admiſſion to hearing the Word, though notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many that hear, have no right to the promiſes held forth in the Word, nor any intereſt in the ſalvation offered in Jeſus Chriſt, but all thoſe in effect ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie nothing to them, yet nevertheleſs all muſt hear, and thoſe are generally and indifferently to be propounded to all; if becauſe the matter of the duty, <hi>viz.</hi> Hearing, is commanded by God, it ought to be performed by all, though many are not qualified to do it in due form, or to a right end, ſince our powers or our proſiciencies are not the meaſure of our duty, but Gods precept, and our obligation is not rooted in, nor reſults from what we can do, but what God will have done, and the good commanded muſt be done, though evil (not cauſally but conſequently, not of it ſelf, but accidentally) enſue in the doing: Why either all theſe conſiderations ſhould not (in ſome meaſure and degree at leaſt) be extenſive and applicable to an admiſſion of all Church-members to the Sacrament, or why (conſidering this) their ſolicitude and ſedulity ſhould not be extended and applied to the trying and preparing men in order to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy hearing, aſwell as to communicating, may ſeem not ſo much below reaſon (as they ſay) to ask, as perhaps above it, to anſwer</p>

               <p>We cannot be ſo blinde or ſo connivent, as not to diſcern that which may fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate us to ſuſpect, that the Sacrament is but the acceſſory, ſome other thing is the principal which is repoſited among <hi>arcana Imperii &amp; ragion di ſtato,</hi> and the wheels of their Diſcipline run Byas, and themſelves like falſe Proxinetes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

That of <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. <hi>Preach the Gospel to every Creature,</hi> is paralel to that of <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Go teach all Nations;</hi> and <hi>to teach,</hi> is (according to the Original) <hi>to diſciple;</hi> and then it might ſeem conſonant, that they ſhould preach to ſuch as were diſciplinable, and in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to be made Diſciples; and then next they may take notice, that it follows <hi>(baptizing them)</hi> whence it will be conſequent, that as they ought onely to admit to baptiſme, ſuch as receive the Word with Faith; ſo to receive, as their Hearers, ſuch alone as entertain the Word firſt offered and propounded to them, without any malicious blaſpheming, or deſpiteful perſecuting thereof (for thoſe onely fall under the denomination of <hi>Swine</hi> and <hi>Dogs,</hi> to whom Pearles are prohibited to be caſt, and <hi>holy things</hi> to be given) and then concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to their principles, even the Heathen ſhould be examined, whether they were ſuch or not, previouſly to, admitting them to be conſtant and profeſs'd Hearers.</p>
               <p>But to ſepoſite the Argument <hi>ad hominem,</hi> and to reflect upon that which may perchance be hence collected and alleaged <hi>ad rem,</hi> as, that if confeſſion of faith be requiſite antecedently to baptiſme, then <hi>à pari,</hi> examination or the like confeſſion, is as neceſſary to the perception of the other Sacrament: I ſhall hereunto reply, That the conſequence doth not hold, becauſe the latter hath neither like example, nor equal reaſon with the former; we find prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents for the one, and until they, like the old <hi>Mercuries,</hi> will with their finger point us the way, where we may find the like for the other, we ſhall be like the <hi>Mercuries</hi> too, ſtand ſtill, and let them be like the Paſſenger to go on their courſe. It carries much of reaſon, that he that renounceth his former princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, ſhould declare and let us know, what beleef he is now become of; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by baptiſme to be initiated into the Church, ſhould tell us what Faith he deſires to be baptized in; there is not the like reaſon for thoſe who being mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the viſible Church, doe formally, as ſuch, make continual profeſſion of faith; the former by a great ſumme (as it were) obtain their freedome, the latter are free-born, but as the Children of Chriſtian Parents, being born, as it were Denizens of the City of God, the Church, doe forthwith receive baptiſme without adjournment thereof, till they are ſuſceptible of making
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:168423:119"/>profeſſion of faith, ſo by ſimilitude of reaſon, ſhould thoſe that are baptized, and intelligent Church-members, be admitted to the other Sacrament, without any farther explicite profeſſing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That examination ſhould ſeem requiſite precedaneouſly to be aring the word</hi> (they ſay) <hi>hath no conformity with Antiquity; for Catechumens and Penitents were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Word, not to the Euchariſt.</hi> But doth it therefore follow, that either they were not, or ought not to be examined, whether they were apt and capable before they had ſuch admiſſion? This onely ſhews, that ſome admitted to the Word, were not permitted the Sacrament; not that thoſe Hearers were put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no tryal, nor needed to be ſo. The <hi>Catechumens</hi> were onely <hi>Embrio's,</hi> and Chriſtians <hi>in fieri,</hi> &amp; but an higher ſtory, or the firſt winnowing of Heathens, &amp; to them is applicable what we have already diſcours'd of: the Penitents in their ſteps to reſtitution, who were admitted to hear in the Porch ſome portions of the Word, not the whole, but before any excommunicate perſon could be indulged the favour of penance, he rendred ſome hopeful ſignes of repentance, which could not be collected but upon ſome tryal; which argueth for us, that there was ſome probation of them, before they were admitted to be complete Hearers; but when they firſt were caſt out, they were as well excluded from the Word, as from the Sacrament, correſpondently to the method of diſcipline among the Jews, where he that was under <hi>Cherem,</hi> did neither teach, nor was taught, which both checks with the practice of the Apologiſts, and confutes their principles.</p>
               <p>To tell us out of <hi>Ames, that the Word goeth before, the Sacraments follow,</hi> doth no more enforce this conſequent, that therefore there needs no examination precedent to the Word, than it follows, that becauſe Baptiſme goes before the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> therefore there is no neceſſity of any examination, or profeſſion of faith to be made antecedently to baptizing adult perſons; or becauſe ſeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time goes before harveſt, therefore no care need to be taken, whether the ground be cultivated and carefully manured, where we caſt our ſeed.

<note place="margin">

               <p n="2">2. That perhaps appropriately, rather than properly, by a denomination ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the more frequent and more ordinary effect thereof, the Sacraments may be called confirming Ordinances, and ſo contradiſtinguiſh'd to the Word.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though as ſeales obſignating, and aſſuring conditionally, they are not without ſome efficacy toward converſion (as ſhall be ſhewed) yet ſeeing in that way they convert onely by confirming, converting to a true ſpecial faith, by confirming and quickning a common general faith; therefore as ſeals they may be ſaid to be primarily confirming Ordinances; and though alſo as ſeals actually and abſolutely confirming relative grace, and exhibiting the benefits and privileges of the Covenant, they ſuppoſe faith either <hi>in fieri,</hi> or <hi>facto eſſe,</hi> Faith being the Condition of the Covenant, whereupon thoſe benefits and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges are beſtowed;

But in their ſenſe, though this diſtinction, this their <hi>Palladium,</hi> (as the old Heathens fabled of theirs) may be pretended to have fallen from Heaven; yet, as other Images, it was the work of mens hands, and of a late framing; and whoſoever ſhall

               <p>But if we ſhould, by <hi>hypotheſis,</hi> allow the diſtinction in their ſenſe, yet it brings nothing pertinent in anſwer to our Argument; for who hath ſo little of natural Logick (if he have no artificial) to judge, that becauſe the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is onely a confirming, and the Word a converting Ordinance, therefore it can poſſibly be conſequent, that pre-examination is requiſite in order to right partaking of the former, not the latter? Who would not rather, without any Prompter, ſuppoſe, that ſuch examination were rather to be required for diſpoſing men to be partakers of the Word, whoſe effects are more general, gracious, and profitable, (as I have elſewhere manifeſted) and where the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard and danger both of <hi>damnum emergens, &amp; lucrum ceſſans,</hi> is more to ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preparedneſs and indiſpoſition? and either due preparation is neceſſary to no Ordinances, ſave ſuch as confirm Faith (and then men may come to the Word unprepared;) or elſe men may come to ſome Ordinances duly prepared without pre-examination.

               <p>But then ſecondly, Is not the Word always an eſſential conſtitutive part of the Sacrament, or can it be a Sacrament, but by acceſſion of the Word (as well inſtructive, as conſecratory) to the Element?

               <p>Thirdly, as <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Chemnicius,</hi> and other Orthodox Divines af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that thoſe ſins lapſed into after Baptiſme, are remitted by Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, renewed by the memory of Baptiſme; ſo alſo the word formerly heard, but not then applyed and laid to heart, being now re-minded by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Sacrament, which elſe had not been recognized, may entitle the Sacrament to be the preſent and immediate cauſe of converſion; and as the word afterward beleeved, makes the Sacrament effectual to an Infant; ſo the <hi>Enchariſt</hi> makes that word afterward more efficacious toward Converſion, which when it was firſt heard, was not received with true Faith. The word calleth it ſelf <hi>a light,</hi> and in creating the new man, illumination by the word hath reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance and <hi>Analogy</hi> with light in the creation of the world, which had the <hi>primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniture</hi> among all the works of God, being mentioned to be firſt made, and is that whereby other of his works are diſcerned and quickned, and enabled for their operations; and as Light is <hi>actus perspicui,</hi> ſo nothing can be acted in any perſpicuity or clearneſs, without the enlightning word; yet notwithſtanding in a clear light, ſome eyes cannot read without the help of Spectacles; and will any man therefore conclude, that thoſe Perſpectives are not meanes or Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of diſcerning Characters, becauſe they have no ſubſerviency to that end, without the adjument of Light? The Chymiſts boaſt much of their <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſa

               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, They will not adventure to ſay, the Sacrament doth confirm Faith, without the acceſſion of the Word thereunto, even formally as it confirmeth; and if the requiſiteneſs of ſuch a connexion of the Word therewith, doth not fruſtrate the Sacrament of the denomination of a confirming Ordinance, why ſhould the like neceſſity of the concurrence of the Word with the Sacrament in converſion, deprive it of the name of a converting Ordinance?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, We pre-ſuppoſe, and lay it as our <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> that none but Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with God, and Church-members, are capable of the Sacraments, and ſuch have been Hearers of the Word, and are pre-endued with a <hi>Dogmatical</hi>-Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Faith; but all that have the Word of Faith, have not the Work of Faith; they beleeve ſpeculatively, but not practically; not laying the promiſes to heart in an efficacious application; they can make out the <hi>Propoſition,</hi> but are not perfect in the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> and Concluſion; have the <hi>Syntereſis</hi> fixed in them, but are ſtrangers to the <hi>Syneideſis,</hi> and <hi>Criſis:</hi> Now the queſtion is, whether the Sacraments are moral Inſtruments, and effectual outward meanes to ſet that knowledge home to the heart, which before was onely floting in the brain, and to ſet open the paſſage between them, and to turn and bring them, that before at diſtance looked toward him, to cloſe up with Chriſt, and to give their heart to him, and caſt their dependencies upon him.</p>
               <p>Not to fetch in any auxiliar ſtrength from that opinion, or bottome any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument thereupon, which ſome learned men embrace, that an Hiſtoricall or Temporary Faith differs onely in degree, not in kinde, from that Faith which <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls <hi>Morata;</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine, Radicata &amp; confirmata,</hi> which if it were ſo, then the Sacrament onely by confirming Faith, and elevating and improving it to greater degrees, might, with more facility, work converſion.</p>
               <p>But howſoever, if they differ in kinde (which to me ſeems to have more warrant from Reaſon) yet the raiſing and increaſing of the degrees, may alter the kinds, as aire advanced to ſome more degrees of rarefaction, and conſequent heat, turns to be fire; ſo ſince the Sacrament by quickning and fomenting the weak degrees of Faith, by confirming it, and making it take root, may adde ſuch ſtrength thereunto, as to make it purifie the heart, and purge the Conſcience from dead works, ſeeing we ſee <hi>Auguſtine</hi> deſcribes true Faith to be onely a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed rooted Faith; and if it have the eſſence of true Faith, it cannot but have the conſequent operation thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> to change the heart; and ſeeing (what was hinted before) as Seales, the Sacraments doe confirm Faith, whether <hi>obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctivè,</hi> making the matter more credible, or <hi>ſubjectivè,</hi> cauſing the perſons, both more facile to credit, and more firmly to adhere to it: therefore he that had attained by the Word to a ſuperficial floating, and ineffectual Faith, may by the Sacrament, improve it to be lively, ſolid, and efficacious, as he that thinks a Note under a mans hand to be no ſecurity, nor will engage or undertake the performance of a duty upon ſuch Aſſurance, will be facilitated to doe it when a
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:168423:122"/>Seal is added to the Writing; and as two Bonds are held ſtronger than one, and two Witneſſes more credible, than a ſingle one; ſo without all doubt, the Obligation of a Promiſe, and the Pawn or Pledge of the Sacrament, avail more to the confirmation of Faith, the underſtanding being by it ſelf more moved by the words and by the ſenſes in the Sacraments,

               <p>Whatſoever effect in the perfecting of Faith, and attracting and uniting the love of the heart unto God in Chriſt, can be produced by the lively apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſerious meditation of the death of Chriſt, and his love in dying for the ſalvation of thoſe that beleeve, the Sacrament may be productive of, which by inſtitution ſign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if the Sacrament may be thereby capable of any ſuch efficacy by repreſenting to the Eye onely, it will be neceſſarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, that the efficacy thereof, in order to that end, muſt be farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when it workes alſo by ſignifying to the other Senſes; and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying ſignes are alſo added to the repreſenting: but though we ſhould not willingly turn out of the way, yet farther to remove this block out of the way of freer admiſſion to the Sacrament; wee ſhall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</p>

               <p>Thirdly, As the benefit is not equal in ſeeing and eating,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In</hi> Eccl. <hi>l.</hi> 3.</note> ſo the danger is alike in either, if they be without Faith; for ſince not onely (as ſaith <hi>Hierom</hi>) in this Myſtery; but in the reading of the Scripture, we eat the Fleſh, and drink the Blood of Chriſt; and the Word preached (as I alleaged out of <hi>Caſaubon</hi>) is a Spiritual Table, and another kinde of ſpiritual eating of Chriſt; therefore to whomſoever, or howſoever ſalvation by the death of Chriſt is repreſented, if not laid hold of by Faith, it turnes to his condemnation, and he hath no life in him, becauſe he eates not the fleſh of the Son of Man, nor drinkes his Blood; ſo that as a man may eat Chriſt ſpiritually, and not ſacramentally, and have the <hi>rem ſigni,</hi> without the <hi>ſignum rei;</hi> ſo he that eates not ſpiritually, contracts damnation, though he be reſtrained from Sacramentall eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>De conſecrat. dist.</hi> 2.</note> was cenſured to merit the puniſhment of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication (as I have elſewhere manifeſted) <hi>peracta conſecratione, omnes communicent, qui noluerint eccleſiaiſticis carere liminibus, ſic enim Apoſtoli ſtatuerunt,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Gratian</hi> recordeth.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, as it is Treaſon to carry Arms and Ammunition to the Enemy, ſo this principle treacherouſly betrayes the Proteſtant Cauſe, and brings Aid to the Popiſh, furniſhing them with an Argument, to juſtifie or excuſe their private Maſſes, and mutilate Communions, if they may be profitable and effectual to ſpectators of the Sacrament, when it is adminiſtred, as well as to participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. And ſure if they doe not lend, they that uſe it borrow this Argument from the <hi>Pontificians, Aut Plato Philonizat, aut Philo Platonizat; Bellarmine</hi> telling us, in his Diſputes againſt our opinion of the Sacraments efficacy by exciting Faith, and operating by their ſignification, correſpondently as the Word doth, (as in truth many of the Arguments uſually urged to diſprove the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be a converting Ordinance, are but feaſting us in that Idol-Temple,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:168423:127"/>and with part of the ſacrifices, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath offered to the God of <hi>Ekron</hi>) that what effect the Sacraments have by ſignification, may be acquired by ſeeing them adminiſtred, as well as by partaking; and from this principle alſo he argueth in defence of the Communion in one kinde, and with the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Heifers have they ploughed, that have found out this Riddle, and (in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion to the antique mode in founding Cities) have turned up this Furrow, and drawn this Line, where to make a Wall to retrench and keep out from the Communion. And perhaps alſo the Papiſts putting their private Maſſes upon the ſcore of the peoples indevotion, hath prompted the Apologiſts and their fellows, to lay their comparatively private Communions, and the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſo many, on the account of their unwillingneſs to come, and on their irreverence; and hereupon to put the blame for the with holding both kindes from ſo many, as among the Papiſts they doe for withdrawing one ſpecies from all, except Prieſts and Kings, ſave that lately the conſecrated Wine is given the Laity, in ſome Countreyes, poured out into a Glaſs, which by no meanes is to be drank out of the Chalice, that the Prieſt may have ſtill ſome privilege and elevation above the people (equal to Kings.) Wherein, as in a glaſs, we may ſee ſomewhat beſides Truth and Godlineſs doth carry on and biaſs the wheeles of this kinde of motions.</p>
               <p>That Argument ſeemes in ſome falſe glaſſes to ſhew a more colourable face of reaſon, which ſome have thus painted; He that receives worthily, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted already; he that partakes unworthily, ears and drinks to his damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not converſion: But this is meer painting, which will neither abide the fire, (or tryal) nor the light of the Sun, and will be defaced by every ſtrong breath that blows upon it.</p>
               <p>But firſt to ſepoſite and adjourn the conſideration, that there lies no little weight of Reaſon and Authority in that ſcale, which propends to think, that the unworthineſs of him which eats and drinks unto damnation, is meant onely of a contrary, not privative unworthineſs, and alone of ſuch as come with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous irreverence, and wilful contempt of the Ordinance; and not of thoſe, that approach with ſome ſenſe of their duty, reverential eſteem of the Myſteries and moral conformity: I ſhall firſt propound it to be conſidered, whether theſe be not ſome of the Weapons, (or formed by their Pattern) wherewith freſh Sophiſters uſe to play at foiles, ſuch as thoſe; Either a man dyes, while he is alive, or when he is dead; either the Light firſt enters into a room, when it is dark, or when it is lightſome; either the ſoul had an exiſtence before it was infuſed into the body, or after; and with either of the horns of this Argument, they think to puſh down an <hi>Antagoniſt,</hi> and make it like a Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile, to vanquiſh him which way ſoever he takes.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall, ſecondly, offer it to be recognized, that the Argument is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Dialect</hi> of the Language of <hi>Aſhdod;</hi> for not onely in <hi>analogous</hi> manner, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> diſputes againſt the Inſtitution of the Legal Sacrifices, for the <hi>typical</hi> expiation of ſinne, <hi>viz.</hi> Either he that offered was juſt, and then needed no ſuch expiatory ſacrifice;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tom.</hi> 4. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>S.</hi> 10.</note> or unjuſt, and then it could not be available to him; and <hi>Chamier</hi> tells him, he might have formed the like Argument againſt the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> as againſt the antiquated ſacrifices, but alſo the Papiſts with like artifice argue againſt juſtification by Faith, that before juſtification nothing in the natural man can juſtifie him, he being at emnity with God, and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:168423:127"/>after he is juſtified, faith cannot do that which is done already; and again, that no man can believe his ſins to be remitted, and himſelf to be accepted as juſt, untill remiſſion of ſins, and ſuch acceptance be obtained, and afterward faith cannot impetrate that which is precedently acquired.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I ſhall hold it forth to be perpended, whether this argument do not lye as directly, and will not reach home as fully to diſmount the Word alſo from being a converting Ordinance; for that profits not, but where it is mixt with faith in the heart, and therefore he that hears with faith, is converted al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, he that doth not ſo, findes it the ſavour of death unto death, and not of life unto life.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we grant that he that hears faithleſly, and he that communicates unworthily, <hi>In ſenſu compoſito,</hi> perſevering in that ſtate and privation, cannot be converted, but is condemned already, but <hi>in ſenſu diviſo,</hi> he that comes without true faith, and unworthy to receive, may yet be converted in recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and be a worthy Receiver; and having eaten of that Lamb (as St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> ſpeakes) may be transformed from a Woolf, that meat not being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the ſubſtance of the partakers, but changing him that partakes into it ſelf; and ſo this Bread which ſignifieth the Body of Chriſt, may not onely ſtrengthen or confirm mans heart, but in that Blood, which the Wine repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth, there ſhall be life. Beſide, the Sacraments are meanes of Grace; and therefore to ſuſpend men from the partaking thereof, till the work of Grace be manifeſt in them, is to ſhut up the means from them, till they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the end; to reſtrain them from Phyſick, till they have recovered into health; to forbid them to waſh their hands with water, till they be clean; and to keep them from the fire, till they be warm. A great Maſter of the School ſets it down as one difference between <hi>infuſed</hi> and <hi>acquiſite</hi> habits, Chriſtian and Philoſophical virtues,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſtius in</hi> 2. <hi>diſt.</hi> 27. <hi>ſect.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 384.</note> that <hi>Virtus Chriſtiana non requirit praeviam actuum fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentiam, ſicut virtus Philoſophica, ſed etiam uno actu acquiratur, aut ſine actu praevio infundatur.</hi> But if infuſed habits were wrought in the manner of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, (as ſome conceive) yet as in natural generations, though the previous diſpoſitions were precedent, yet the introduction of the form is momentaneous; ſo in Regeneration, though the Word heard have wrought ſome preparations and prediſpoſitions, yet the new heart may be conferred at the inſtant of receiving, and the new name be given together with the <hi>Manna,</hi> whereby the ultimate diſpoſition to that form may be wrought, by the infuſion of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Spirit, and as though <hi>Sol &amp; homo generant hominem,</hi> yet the man as the <hi>proximous</hi> and immediate natural cauſe, is called the Father of the childe, and not the Son; ſo the Sacrament, though enlivened and quickened by the Word, may be notwithſtanding juſtly named the moral cauſe of converſion; and whenſoever elſe that new heart is inſpired, and that change wrought, yet as in natural mutations, when there is a tranſition from one ſtate to another, and from privation to a form or habit, the ſame individual moment is the end of the one, and beginning of the other, <hi>Illud in quo aliquid primo mutatum, inſtans eſt,</hi> and the <hi>Ultimum non eſſe unius, eſt primum eſſe alterius;</hi> and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the moſt of Philoſophers affirm, <hi>Omne quod movetur, partim eſt in termino à quo, &amp; partim in termino ad quens;</hi> and alſo as <hi>In motu recto cum reflectione, non datur quies intermedia;</hi> ſo in ſome <hi>analogy</hi> herewith, when there is (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Word or Sacraments) a change from a carnal to a ſpiritually rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:168423:128"/>eſtate (though there be antecedent diſpoſitions to grace, yet thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but <hi>preludial</hi> influences of grace, therefore notwithſtanding) though the laſt act in the carnal ſtate were ſuitable to that principle, yet the firſt act in the ſpiritual, flows from the fountain of that new life, and it ſhall be a ſtrange piece of unreaſonableneſs to argue, that becauſe that man and that act were evil in the former inſtant, that neither can be better in the next, or that the precedent indiſpoſitions ſhall obſtruct or vitiate the ſubſequent operations.</p>
               <p>Relative grace is conferred by the Sacrament upon condition of faith, which it may therefore preſuppoſe, as precedent in nature, though it be <hi>ſimulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous</hi> in time, but real grace cannot precede nor preſuppoſe faith, for then it ſhould go before, and be preſuppoſed to it ſelf; The gracious benefits of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant are promiſed and propoſed upon condition of faith, but faith is not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered or promiſed upon condition of believing. True faith onely gives an intereſt and right in the <hi>Res Sacramenti, &amp; Panis Dominus,</hi> but an hiſtorical <hi>dogmatical</hi> faith, and outward profeſſion thereof, conſtitutes a Church-member, and that lends the title to the <hi>Sacramentum rei, &amp; Panis Domini,</hi> (and yet the receiving of the later may be a ſubſervient means to elevate and promove that hiſtorical, to a ſaving faith, which may bring to the participation of the former.)</p>
               <p>And as ſound faith is neceſſary to that hearing, whereby the ſoul may live, but not to hearing ſimply and abſolutely, but men hear that they may believe, not onely becauſe they have believed; ſo it is in the receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and what <hi>Chamier</hi> tells <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> I may ſay to them, that will have none but ſuch as are approved faithfull, to be admitted to this ſeal of faith, <hi>Paulus circumciſionem pronunciat fuiſſe ſignum &amp; ſigillum fidei,

               <p>But as it did not follow, that if the Sacrament were no converting Ordinance, that examination were a more neceſſary Antecedent to an admiſſion, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it conſequent, that therefore none ought to be admitted that cannot convince others of their converſion, for that concluſion cannot be diſtilled but by ſuch a <hi>medium,</hi> that unconverted men muſt not be permitted to do or undertake any duties which they cannot well and duly diſcharge; but he that ſo judgeth, is not yet converted from an errour, as dangerous, as manifeſt for the Apologiſts eliminate Prayer alſo from converting Ordinances, yet know they have not yet met with any ſuch new light, as hath led them to tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I know the trite (I dare not ſay trivial) ſimilitude, that it fareth with the Miniſter, in order to the Sacrament, and the diſpenſing thereof, as with one that hath a Cup of Poyſon in his hand, for whom it is not enough to ſhew the danger in drinking thereof, and to perſwade to abſtain from the ſame; but if he reach it forth, and deliver it to any, he is guilty of all the miſchief, conſequent to the ſwallowing thereof.</p>

               <p>Fourthly, it is not the receiving condemns, but the receiving with that wicked diſpoſition; which remaining unrepented, would condemn, though they received not; the act of receiving in the unworthy, is not evil, <hi>ex genere &amp; objecto,</hi> but onely <hi>ex fine &amp; circumſtantiis,</hi> (as hath been ſaid) and the evil effect is alone in the evil manner of doing; and as a co-operation by another in ſuch acts, or a permiſſion thereof, doth not contract a ſatiety in the evil, which is not cauſed or conſented to; ſo neither will the poſſibility, or hazard of an evil accidentally conſequent thereunto, palliate or excuſe a Miniſters intermiſſion of Divine Ordinances, for elſe he might be ſecure from any woe for not preaching the Goſpel, ſince the Word being a ſavour of death unto death, when it is not received with Faith, (which all have not) it might be more ſafe and more charitable not to preach it, leſt it ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate ſome mens condemnation; and for ought I know, upon ſuch princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples he might forbear to hold ſorth the Lord Jeſus, as the true way of Life, becauſe he is alſo ſet for the fall of many, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.34. and to be a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a Rock of offence, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 8.14.</p>

               <p>Secondly, by retorſion, as in a College, all that are (as we uſe to ſay) of the Foundation, doe partake of the Donatives of the Founder, until upon expulſion or ſequeſtration upon juſt cauſe, they forfeit them; and that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage is diſcovered not by private ſcrutiny, but by publick obſervation and judgment; nor upon ſurmiſes, but proof and ſentence thereupon given; ſo have all intelligent perſons actually within the viſible Church (the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of the faithful) by Title of their common Hiſtorical Faith onely, a right to the Ordinances, and external common privileges, bequeathed by our Lord Chriſt, until by obſtinacy in notorious ſins, they merit to be expelled, and put from the Communion, and are accordingly ſentenced judicially, not arbitrarily, or upon private ſurmiſes and ſuſpicions; and in very deed there is no one falſe ſpecies hath more impoſed upon them, than this, that if none ought to be admitted, but ſuch as are worthy, that therefore ſpecial proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be made of the worthineſs of every one, which hath a palpable fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy in the conſequent; and is juſt as if I ſhould argue, the Law allowes no Ideot to be admitted to the managery of his eſtate, therefore every man muſt come under examination, (whether he be an Ideot, or not) as if a generall obſervation and converſe could not ſuffice to make diſcovery and give judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>I am conſcious alſo of that Rule, that a man is guilty of every ſinne he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours not to hinder; but notwithſtanding it thereupon follows not, that the Paſtor and Elders engage and enfeoffe themſelves in other mens unworthy receiving, unleſs they make probation of them, thereby to diſcover and impede their ſinne of receiving unworthily.</p>
               <p>For firſt, no man is guilty in not hindering that ſinne which he knowes not, (<hi>nullius crimen maculat neſcientem,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) nor hath any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, nor any authority to make particular ſearch and enquiry after, the Church is onely to judge of open crimes and ſcandals, not of things ſecret and occult.</p>

               <p>Secondly, it muſt be an imminent, an apparent evil, and evil in it ſelf, and in its own nature; for I am not obliged to ſnatch away a mans meat, left he ſurfeit; nor take his purſe, leſt he ſquander his money in debauches; no nor at all times to ſeize his ſword, leſt he doe miſchief with it, unleſs it be evident to me, that he intends ſo to abuſe it; and into his intention, if ſecret, am not bound to make any ſolicitous ſcrutiny; nor to diſarm him upon the warrant of my proper ſuſpicion, much leſs may I hinder him of doing that which is good in it ſelf, for fear leſt it become evil to him by accident, elſe I muſt keep him from hearing the Word, leſt he receive it not with faith, and ſo it condemn him; the poſſibility that he may doe well and receive good with or by the thing, eſpecially when that thing is intrinſically good; and the hope which Charity ſhould prompt me to, that it ſhall become good to him, is ſufficient to diſoblige me from impeding him in it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if the matter be neceſſary, and the failer be onely in the manner of doing it, the rule holds not; for (to crop one Ear of a whole Harveſt, and inſtance in one of many caſes) how elſe could a Chriſtian Prince with a ſafe Conſcience, for confirmation of a League, take an Oath from an Heathen by his falſe Gods, and not rather hinder ſuch Idolatry; but that the Sacraments are reſpectively neceſſary, <hi>neceſſitate praecepti,</hi> is denyed by none, and granted by moſt, to be ſo <hi>neceſſitate medii ordinarii.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now laſtly, concerning thoſe that ſhould receive (whom we know to have the greateſt intereſt in the <hi>lucrum ceſſans,</hi> while the Sacrament ought to be exhibited to them and is not; and whom they ſuppoſe to have no leſs ſhare in the <hi>Damnum emergens,</hi> when the Sacrament is adminiſtred to them, and ought not) I ſhall ſay, that as it was ſpoken of <hi>Adrian,</hi> The multitude of Phyſicians had killed the Emperour; ſo let ſome men conſider, whether or no, while they fear accidentally to loſe or hazard thoſe ſoules, they doe not more endanger them, and their own ſoules too, by with-holding from them the Sacramenr, which is Gods Ordinance; and therefore the likelyeſt means conducing to their ſalvation: It is a cruel fault to deny corporal bread to the hungry; a greater to with-hold the food of the ſoul; and that of <hi>Gregory</hi> is here applyable, <hi>He kills, that doth-not feed;</hi> Chriſt choſe to converſe with ſinners, that he might win them off from ſinne unto himſelf, and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the King gathered together to the Marriage-feaſt, good and bad; the ſeparation was made by the King at his coming, not by his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.10. And who can gain-ſay, but that as Chriſt by breaking of bread, was made known to his Diſciples at <hi>Emaus,</hi> whoſe eyes were former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holden that they could not know him: ſo the frequent receiving of the Sacrament may better fit and diſpoſe them for receiving, and bring them to a clearer ſight, and more ſpecial application of Chriſt unto ſalvation. There is ſcarce any, but takes ſome little reverence of the myſteries, improves or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes ſome notions of the redemption of mankinde, by the death of Chriſt, carryes away ſome ſmall impreſſions of good things, at leaſt for the preſent, ſome diſpoſitions, though not habits; and how thoſe weak ſeeds may be quickned and ripened by frequent communicating, can be onely known to God; but we may charitably hope for multiplyed acts, beget and perfect habits; and in this reſpect there is a ſimilitude between habits infuſed, and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:168423:134"/>acquiſite (though the acquiſt of the former have a ſpecial aſſiſtance and inſpiration of Gods gracious Spirit) Uſe makes prompt; and Phyſicians tell us, that when Appetite is dull, and digeſtion weak, yet both may be increaſed by moderate refection; whereas to exclude any from the Sacrament, becauſe he is not ſo well prepared as he ought, is to deny a man a medicine, becauſe he is ſick, for which cauſe he chiefly needs it. Defects in the manner and form will not diſcharge or ſuperſede any from the matter of duties, elſe they might plead excuſe for the intermiſſion of prayer, or excluding others from it, becauſe they cannot pray without diſtractions and other indiſpoſitions; and from hearing, becauſe of defects in the attention of mind, or devotion in the affections; he that performs the matter, and communicates, though with a failer in the manner, ſo it be without malice or preſumption, doth ſome part of his duty; and ſheweth ſome, though but an outward regard and conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Gods Ordinance; and ſo I ſhould think were a leſſe ſinner, than he that altogether deſpiſeth or neglects it. <hi>Est aliquid prodire tenus:</hi> the one is <hi>malum per ſe;</hi> the other onely <hi>per accidens;</hi> that which is not done with a perfect heart, may yet be good in the ſight of the Lord; as it was ſaid of <hi>Amazias,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.2. it may be <hi>bonum,</hi> though not <hi>bene;</hi> and it may be impetratory of ſome reward, though not of one eternal.

One chief end of the Inſtitution of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, was to ſhew forth the Lords death: And the recordation thereof, and external acknowledgment of Chriſt to be the Redeemer of the World by his death, being made by a greater number, though not all ſo well diſpoſed, or inwardly qualified as they ought, may yet ſomewhat conduce to Gods glory, and the end of the Inſtitution. It was matter of rejoycing unto St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that Chriſt was preached, though out of envy and ſtrife, and contention; not ſincerely: An outward formal humiliation in <hi>Ahab,</hi> was ſo farre accepted by God, as to mittigate his puniſhment; and the externall performance of the command by <hi>Jehu,</hi> though upon ſiniſter ends, and with culpable affections, procured a temporal reward. He that is not againſt us, by being ſcandalous, is on our part, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.40. and therefore ſhould be a partaker with us; and its our part to cheriſh and encourage him, in hope to bring him neerer, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than by a diſcountenance and diſcouragement, to hazard the driving of him farther off; <hi>The perfection of the beſt, is an imperfect perfection; the beſt part thereof conſiſts in the ſight of their imperfection,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bernard; and the greateſt peece of our righteouſneſs, is an agnition in truth, and a confeſſion in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, of our unrighteouſneſs; and Gods commands are then only reputed to be done, when that which is not done is forgiven,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> If the denomination be taken from the major part, our firmeſt beleeving is rather unbeleefe, than faith; as he that ſaid in the Goſpel, <hi>I beleeve Lord,</hi> yet prayed, <hi>help</hi> (not my faith, but) <hi>my unbeleef.</hi> He that hath the beſt preparation and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Spirit, for an approach to theſe holy myſteries, muſt yet fly to Chriſt Jeſus, to have the blemiſhes thereof covered with his righteouſneſs; and the
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:168423:134"/>defects thereof to be ſupplyed by his fulneſs; and he that owns the meaneſt, and the weakeſt, if in any degree ſincere, may by the ſame means obtain an elevation and acceptance thereof; for it is onely Chriſt his ſtamp, and not our metal, that can make it paſs current, and the garments of our Elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alone, that can make us capable of the bleſſing: As therefore the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church for ſeveral Centuries (though upon erroneous principles) gave the Euchariſt to Infants in years; ſo the Church ever did, and upon ſuch conſiderations may ſtill, without errour, exhibit it to Babes in Chriſt; and ſuch we are charitably to ſuppoſe the weakeſt to be, that profeſs his Name, and by the great tranſgreſſion, and abominable iniquity, doe not evidently belye their profeſſion.</p>
               <p>We have been cautioned by the admonition of <hi>Marlorat</hi> and <hi>Spanheym,</hi> that to deſert or ſeparate from the Communion, becauſe of the admiſſion of ſome, in their opinion, wicked or unworthy, doth ſymbolize with the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt, and hath a raſte of their Leaven; but whether thoſe principles, that it is of neceſſity to make probation of their fitneſs and worthineſs, that are to be admitted to the Holy Supper; and that this Sacrament being a Seal of Faith, ought not ordinately to be adminiſtred to thoſe that have not Faith, may not alſo be extenſive, and aſwell applicable to the Sacrament of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, and ſo do tacitely advance and drive on alſo the intereſt of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, who will have none to be baptized, untill they have given ſure evidence of their ſound Faith and real Converſation, and unawares mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in the Tents of, and run Biaſs toward, that faction, I ſhall not make reſearch into, much leſs dare to determine, but transferre and reſign the conſideration thereof to more comprehenſive judgments, it ſhall be enough for me with the Piſmire in the Apologue, To awaken the Lion, and make him look about.</p>

               <p>Secondly, concerning hearing of the Word; The concluſion that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to take examination of men previouſly to the Sacrament, and to make tryal whether they are worthy or not to be admitted, is deduced and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from that principle, <hi>He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf, not diſcerning the Lords Body.</hi> But now try and examine (I beſeech you) ſince the Word is ſaid to be the ſavour of death unto death, and that the Word ſhall judge them in the laſt day that hear it; and there is a caution, Take heed how you hear, and qualifications required in hearing, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.21. and men hating inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>Though ſurely by the way, that Text cannot be very pertinent, nor well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyable to the point for which they produce it; for thoſe Pearls are prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to be caſt before Swine,

               <p>But let us examine what they interpoſe to diſprove our paralel of reaſons; verily much pargetting there is, to ſhew a diſpariry between the Word and Prayer and the Sacraments, and to ſet them at difference, which agree ſo well in the common and generical notion of Ordinances; and it is remarkable to contemplate how the Sacraments are uſed, like Caſting-Counters, ſometimes ſtanding for one hundred, and then again but for ten, according to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and intereſt of the Diſpoſer, to ſerve one turn they are ſometimes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced into a Sphere higher than the Word, and we may ſomewhere meet with a fardle, of what by a charitable conſtruction, we may call Reaſons,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:168423:136"/>pack'd together to this purpoſe, and Rhetorically enough diſplayed, which yet indeed are but parcels of ſmall Wares, and which are like the Duke of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's</hi> Souldiers, <hi>Briton</hi>'s in <hi>Engliſh</hi>-mens Caſſocks; to accommodate another end, they are at other times degraded, ſet many Orbs lower, and their virtue more diſparaged and alleviated, as upon this inſtant occaſion, we are told by ſome, that Prayer and hearing the Word is a duty commanded; but there is no Precept, that wicked men ſhould come to the Sacrament; that in the one, the matter is good, and there is onely a failer in the manner; but in the other, both matter and manner are faulty, and that by Prayer and hearing of the Word, they may acquire ſome good, temporal at leaſt, and mitigation of puniſhment, but not ſo by communicating; and therefore the Reaſons are not alike for the admiſſion, probation of, and conjunction with unconverted, irregenerate, and unworthy men, to and in the former and latter Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>But I take leave to anſwer, That it is the unanimous ſuffrage of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, aſſerted by our Divines againſt the Papiſts, in the queſtion whether the Communion in both kindes be neceſſary, that <hi>Take, Eat, Drink ye all of this, Do this, Shew forth the Lords death,</hi> (as ſome learned man will have it read) are explicite commands, words not onely of invitation, of power, of liberty,

It ſeems to me a ſad and piacular enunciation, that the receiving of the Sacrament by an unworthy perſon, is ſaid to be materially evil, or <hi>ex genere &amp; objecto,</hi> though I deny not, it may become ſo, <hi>Ad hîc &amp; nunc, ex fine &amp; circumſtantiis.</hi> I ſuppoſe the Author that dropp'd thoſe inconſiderate words, might juſtly with the Annular or Phyſick-fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, touch the place behinde the right ear conſecrate to <hi>Nemeſis,</hi> which among the Ancients was uſed by them, that begg'd pardon of their gods for any inconſiderate and obnoxious ſpeech; what influence and effect the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the Sacrament may have upon unconverted and faithleſs perſons, I have elſewhere ſpoken, and need not here to recapitulate.</p>
               <p>That which is moſt commonly, and moſt ſpeciouſly, and by the beſt learned, objected to prove that there is not the like reaſon in this caſe, in relation to the hearing of the Word, and receiving of the Sacraments, is this, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:168423:136"/>are not converting Ordinances, (as the Word is) there being no inſtitution, nor promiſe, nor command, to uſe them to that end, but they are onely ſealing Ordinances, and conferre not, but confirm Faith, preſuppoſe it, and teſtifie our union with Chriſt; not beget it; that the Word is to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to thoſe that believe not, but the Sacraments to be adminiſtred onely to believers, and thoſe properly and really believers, which not onely aſſent to the Word of Faith, but to the work of Faith, believing practically, aſwell as ſpeculatively, elſe the Seal ſhould be ſet to a Blank, and there ſhould be a falſe teſtimony in witneſſing that which is not, and ſo be a practical Lye; ſome few perchance attribute more to Baptiſm, as to be a regenerating Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, but the Lords Supper they think is nothing like, as if it were more to be the Laver of Regeneration, than the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, or as if it were not the ſame internal grace, exhibited under divers external ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficative Elements.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> to verifie that opinion that the Sacraments conferre grace <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> are conſtrained to aſſert a Total falling from grace; ſo theſe men to defend and maintain with more facility this Tenent, that the Sacraments are no converting Ordinances, have alſo thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to deny alſo, that they conferre grace, and with an admirable confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence obtrude this, as the Doctrine of all Reformed Churches.</p>
               <p>I am not willing to ſtart and proſecute more Controverſies at once; this which I have primarily taken into agitation will engage enough of time and paper. I remember <hi>Torquatus</hi> his fate, that though he killed an Enemy, yet ſuffered puniſhment, becauſe he went out of his Rank and Order to do it: I ſhall therefore appoſitely to the preſent ſubject anſwer, That they need not tell us of differences between the Word and Sacraments; no ſeveral things but have their different properties, elſe they could not be ſeverall things; they might deliver us more diſparities; but what are thoſe they mention to make a difference between the Preparation or Probation, needfull to the one and the other, and the Communion and Fellowſhip in the one and not the other. Let it be (as it is pretended) that the one is a converting, and the other a confirming Ordinance; doth it therefore follow, that there muſt be a preexamining of the fitneſs of men in order to the one, and not the other? that we may admit of the ſociety and concurrence of formal Profeſſors in the one, and not in the other? Let it be ſo, (as it is ſuggeſted) but is not then the Word the more bleſſed, gracious, and venerable Ordinance? as to give being, is more than to ſupply food, and to infuſe life, more than to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe ſtrength, and ſo calls for more reverence, purity, and preparation, in order thereunto, as more honour is due unto our Parents, than to our Nurſe, and Lawyers put more weight upon thoſe words in a Deed, <hi>Give</hi> and <hi>Grant,</hi> than upon that of <hi>Confirm. Ipſum eſſe perfectiſſimum omnium,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>q.</hi> 4. <hi>ar.</hi> 1.</note> comparatur enim ad omnia, ut actus, nihil enim habet actualitatem niſi in quantum eſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> and the more noble Effects make the Cauſes more noble; and is not the World to all Ordinances, (as Faith to the Juſt) and to all righteouſneſs, the life and ſoul thereof? Others beſide Believers (ſay they) may be admitted to the hearing of the Word, but yet muſt no care be had, nor triall made, whether thoſe that hear, believe or not, or are diſpoſed to believe? And is it no matter whether the Word become the ſavour of death? onely courſe
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:168423:137"/>muſt be taken, that the Sacrament become not deadly, no matter though the word be ſo? And if none muſt be admitted to the Sacrament but thoſe that have Faith, then none can receive admiſsion, for who can be aſſured that another hath Faith, which is rooted in the heart, which onely God ſearcheth? the hidden man of the heart is inviſible to any forrein eys, the hidden Manna cannot be taſted by any other than he that imboſomes it, and the new name is not legible by any, ſave a reflected beam of light.</p>
               <p>If it be anſwered, that they intend onely that ſuch are to be admitted, who by a diſcurſive knowledge collected by external ſignes in the converſation, and reaſoning from one thing to another, they conclude to be faithful and regenerate: I anſwer, that ſuch knowledge is not infallible, they may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and doubtleſs are in many; and therefore in admitting of ſome, they muſt needs ſet the ſeal to a blank, and are falſe Witneſſes, and practical Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in relation to ſuch, as notwithſtanding this probation doe deceive them; neither can their endeavors to the contrary ſalve the thing, being notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding done, though it may render the perſons more excuſable for doing it, who alſo muſt ſtill be perplex'd and anxious, whether the ſignes be ſufficient, and the judgment regular.</p>
               <p>There may be alſo a partial and male-adminiſtration of Diſcipline, and an approbation of the unworthy, who may perhaps <hi>aſcendere ad altare per gradus,</hi> by ſtairs of favour ſundry ways impetrated, and in ſuch caſes (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they yet preſcribe, that there ought to be no intermiſſion of the Synaxis, nor ſeparation from the Church) all the prejudices, and pollutions, and profanations, which they ſo much amplifie and declaim againſt, in mix'd Communions, doe ariſe and occurre.</p>
               <p>But what doe the Sacraments ſeal, more than the Word aſſures? ſave that the one applyes that more particularly, which the other holds forth general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and doth it by a repreſentation to the eye, and hand, and mouth, which the other doth unto the Ear: Circumciſion is indeed called a ſeal of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Faith; And as by an analogy and proportionable accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may our Sacraments be ſo named; ſo God openeth the ear, and ſealeth inſtruction; alſo <hi>Job</hi> 33.16. and binds up the teſtimony, and ſeals the Law among his Diſciples, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.16. Methinks when I reflect on this Argument of theirs, I re-mind that ſophiſme of the Arminians, who argue, That which every man is bound to beleeve is true; but that Chriſt dyed for him, is that which every man is bound to beleeve: <hi>ergo,</hi> Which Argument ſeems to me to have ſome ſimilitude with this, That which ſeales Chriſt, and remiſſion of ſins unto Faith, pre-ſuppoſeth Faith in them, to whom the Scal is applyed; but the Sacraments ſeal Chriſt and remiſſion of ſins to Faith, <hi>ergo;</hi> and the like anſwer may ſerve to the one and other fallacy, <hi>viz.</hi> That as no man is bound to beleeve that Chriſt dyed for him, unleſs he beleeve and repent, but is rather bound not to beleeve it, the death of Chriſt becoming effectuall to him onely upon condition of his Faith and repentance, and the aſſurance thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> That he ſhall be ſaved by Chriſts death, being a conoluſion that reſults from a <hi>Major</hi> propoſition (he that beleeves and repents ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by the death of Chriſt,) and a Minor (I beleeve and repent) ſo the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments ſeal not the donation of Chriſt, and remiſſion of ſinnes, in and through him, but upon the condition of faith and repentance, juſt as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:168423:137"/>hold forth Chriſt in the Word preached: And therefore the Seal is not put to a blanck, but offered to be ſet, if Covenants be performed, as a man ſeals a Writing to become his Deed, when Conditions be performed, elſe to be as an Eſcrol; to the faithleſs the Sacrament is a Seal in <hi>actu primo,</hi> not in <hi>actu ſecundo:</hi> a Seal ſtill in its own nature, not in the effect, a Seal obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively, <hi>viz.</hi> of the conditional Covenant and Promiſes, not ſubjective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>viz.</hi> of Faith in that perſon, as the Seal doth not ratifie the ſervices of the Tenant, but the Grant of the Lord upon condition of performing the homage and fealty.</p>
               <p>Whether the Sacrament be a converting Ordinance or not, I ſhall onely ſay ſuccinctly, That they which deny it, doe but prevaricate; for they ſay, that the Sacrament abſtracted from the Word, and without it, converts not, which is as much as to ſay, that the Sacrament, when it is no Sacrament, doth not convert; for without the annexion of the Word, it is no Sacrament, <hi>Accedat verbum ad elementum, &amp; fiet ſacramentum;</hi> which our Divines (with excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent reaſon) underſtand not onely of the Word as conſecratory, but as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cional, and as a word of Doctrine, teaching the nature, end, and uſe thereof, for they have no efficacy, but by mediation of Faith, and that hath alwayes relation to the Word, ſuch a Word as is effectual, not <hi>quia dicitur, ſed quia creditur,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Augustine.</hi> But whether Converſion be wrought by the Sacrament, or at the Sacrament (as they would have it) obſerve (I beſeech you) to be all one to our purpoſe, ſo as Converſion be effected; but indeed Faith hath three acts, Knowledge and Aſſent in the Underſtanding; and Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the Will and Affections; ſo that true juſtifying Faith, is a fiduciall Aſſent pre-ſuppoſing Knowledge; now the queſtion truly ſtated is this, Where there is an acquiſt and antecedency of knowledge and aſſent onely, which is but an Hiſtorical or Dogmatical Faith, whether that affiance, which is a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of a mans ſelf upon Chriſt, and a cloſing up with him, and together wherewith is alwayes a Converſion of the heart, and a renewing of the ſpirit of the minde, cannot be wrought in the inſtant of receiving, or be the effect of the Sacrament, (as a moral cauſe) as well by the holy Spirits infuſing of that internal formal principle, or gracious habit of juſtifying faith; as alſo quickning the preſent actual exerciſe thereof, in embracing of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, whom though they had formerly heard of by the ear, yet they never, untill then, felt in the heart?</p>
               <p>This I think, ſo well explained, cannot well be denyed; and until our age, I am confident, was never queſtioned. In this ſame way miracles, afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the converſation of the Wives, may actually convert, much more the Sacrament, which effects it not accidentally and extraordinarily, as the other; but <hi>ut medium ordinarium, &amp; ex natura ſuae inſtitutionis &amp; speciali or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinatione divina.</hi> The Word begets Faith, onely by way of object propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; for Faith (as all ſpiritual graces are) is infuſed into the ſoul, and there produced, <hi>per modum creationis,</hi> not by any natural operation, but by a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural and immediate act and influence of Gods Spirit, which begets Faith, by illuminating of the minde, and inclining the Will to apprehend and imbrace the object; and in the ſame way that the Word worketh, are the Sacraments operative;

               <p>Laſt of all, let us take one proſpect farther, and upon view make triall, whether the motives uſed, to perſwade the Adminiſtration of the Lords Supper, and the Retentives applied to keep men from deſerting the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation thereof, when by a male-adminiſtration of Diſcipline, either through negligence or corruption, wicked men are admitted, cannot alſo be as apt and proper and ſuitable to the ſame ends and purpoſes generally in mix'd Congregations, and where Diſcipline is not at all eſtabliſhed, or for weighty Reaſons cannot be executed. They tell us in that former caſe, that we joyn not with wicked men, but they with us; that for us to joyn with ſinfull men in ſinful matters, would bring guilt upon us; but if ſome bad men will joyn with us in good matters, it proves no prejudice to us. To celebrate the Lords Supper, is in it ſelf exceeding good, if others that ought not will come and goe as farre with us, as the outward act, it is evil to them, but none to us, having to our power oppoſed their preſence (which power we are elſewhere taught to be admoniſhing, reproving, and mourning, &amp;c.) We are farther bid to take heed that we neglect not an undoubted duty, to eſcape an uncertain danger; a peril merely ſuppoſed, will not warrant the omitting of a practice cleerly impoſed; <hi>O bracteata verba!</hi> whereupon I ſhall make no long refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but briefly ſay, that great is the truth and will prevail; and onely ask whether this breath blow not away all their former ſimilitudes and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; Whether this be not <hi>herbam dare</hi> to give up the cauſe, and flight or quit their ſtrongeſt holds? and like <hi>Penelope,</hi> to untwiſt her own Web, and to become like an Eagle ſtruck down with an Arrow, feathered from her own Wing, as was <hi>Julian's</hi> Motto, <hi>Propriis configimur alis:</hi> for now,
<q>Neſcio quo pacto, vox tua facta mea est.</q> Onely if they ſhall interpoſe that in male-adminiſtration of diſcipline ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what is yet done, and onely ſome few evil men are admitted, but in non-eſtabliſhment, or non-execution thereof, nothing is effected, and many more doe intrude to the Holy Table; I anſwer, that as <hi>magìs &amp; minùs non vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant speciem,</hi> ſo the multitude or paucity cannot give form, though it may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to the quality of the action, in the one caſe or another: if it be evil to admit or communicate with many hypocrites or wicked men, it is alſo evill to doe it, though but with a few ſuch; and the evil is greater, becauſe done by them, who are always ſo much the worſe, by how much more they pretend to be better; and by the help of Diſcipline eſtabliſhed, have the means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct things better: but let ſuch Diſcipline be eſtabliſhed, ſo that where and when they pleaſe, it may be exerciſed; and then it ſeemes it is nothing ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous or placular, though ſome be admitted or communicated with, as unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, as thoſe that now are repelled. Truly, the reflection upon thoſe, and the like paſſages, is that which tempts ſome circumſpect men to ſuſpect, that the Silver-Smith is ſtill at his Work-houſe for his <hi>Diana, (&amp; quiſquis amat ranam, ranam putat eſſe Dianam)</hi> whoſe Arguments, though hammered at the

               <p>Secondly, by this Burthen they either underſtand a load of ſorrow, or of ſin, <hi>malum poenae aut malum culpae,</hi> if the firſt, though it is abſolutely true, that we contract and enfeoffe upon our ſelves thoſe ſinnes, which we ſee and mourn not for; and as the beſt complexion hath the perfecteſt touch, ſo a righteous ſoul like <hi>Lot</hi> (<hi>Cujus perſecutio facta mala ſodomitarum erant,</hi> ſaith <hi>Augustine</hi>) cannot but be vexed with unlawful deeds; yet comparatively, why the ſinne of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy receiving ſhould be ſingled out, as a more ſpecial object of, or greater motive to ſorrow, than other ſinnes; or that it ſhould lye with more weight, or more tender reſentment upon the ſpirits, to communicate in mix'd Congregations with unworthy Receivers, than with thoſe that hear or pray without Faith: ſurely this ſeems to me no paſſion reſulting from any ſenſible cauſe, but an Antipathy, whereof no Reaſon can be aſſigned; and I think there is as much cauſe of grief and obligation to ſorrow, for the one as the other; like as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> told the Donatian Biſhops (if we ſhall gratifie <hi>Creſconius</hi> ſo far, as to call them ſo, rather than <hi>Donatiſts</hi>) refuſing to ſit with the Orthodox in the Aſſemblies, and juſtifying their refuſal by <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.1. that they had as much ground from that Text, Not to ſtand in the way of ſinners, as, Not to ſit in the ſeat of the ſcornful; and therefore in this comparative reſpect, this is a burden or ſcandal <hi>acceptum, non datum,</hi> and nothing need to make the Load ſo heavy, but to think it is ſo. And I doubt it fares with them, as with thoſe labouring under the Diſeaſe called <hi>Incubus,</hi> who complain of ſomewhat lying heavily upon them, when the perturbation is onely from their own diſtemper'd humours and phantaſms. And as the Altar which <hi>Pauſanias</hi> mentions, whereby the Women Propheteſſes (thoſe <hi>fatuae fatidicae</hi>) divined in the Temple, ſome felt it light, and ſome heavy, according to their condition; ſo it is onely the weak or ſore ſhoulders, which renders light things burdenſome, <hi>nihil gravitat in
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:168423:147"/>proprio loco;</hi> and as they ſay, he that lyes at the bottome of the Sea, feeles not the weight of the incumbent water, becauſe both are in their proper places, the man neerer the Center, and the Water farther removed; ſo thoſe that unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily approach the Holy Table, yet as long as they continue Church-members, being in their due place, their coming ſhould not be ſo extraordinarily burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to any.

               <p>But for anſwer, we may firſt obſerve what obliging and endearing ways they have to work upon and win their People, and they might conſider, that it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much derogates from the credit of their Miniſtery, that they have ſuch a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as from the Honor of their Charity, that they can ſpeak nothing but Dirt and Daggers of them; but as when a Virgin was to be put to death, ſhe muſt firſt be defloured and vitiated, before ſhe could be executed, ſo they muſt needs avile and aſperſe their People to juſtifie themſelves; but when <hi>Rubirius</hi> condemned by <hi>Caeſar</hi> appealed to the People, <hi>Nihil aequè ac judicis acerbitas profuit,</hi> ſo we cannot but look more compaſſionately upon their Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, becauſe they uſe them ſo ſpitefully, whom we are confident a great part of them like <hi>Anteius</hi> and <hi>Oſtorius</hi> in <hi>Tacitus</hi> to be <hi>inter damnatos magìs quàm reos,</hi> and their quarrel againſt them, to be like that of <hi>Fimbria</hi> againſt <hi>Scaevola, totum telum non recipit,</hi> they will not receive their Yoke.</p>

               <p>But fourthly, whatſoever they were, it was not the truth and reality of their faith, that admited them to Baptiſm, but the external profeſſion of the faith, their continuance ſtedfaſt in the faith what ever it importeth, was a thing ſubſequent, they had not continued, when they onely began to believe, and

               <p>Next, that they remove the antient Land-mark of that diſtinction between the Church of the Called, and that of the Elect, may be diſcerned by any that paſſeth by their way.

And though we think it not proper to ſay that men are ſealed but the promiſes to them, yet like <hi>Mercury</hi> to battologize with <hi>Battus,</hi> and uſe their forms, we are not ſo fooliſh to think, whether or no they be ſo fond to imagine, that any that are uncal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſhould be ſealed, for the Sacraments being the proper cognizances of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, are not communicable to any but Chriſtians, and the profeſſion of the faith is as <hi>teſſera hospitalis,</hi> without which none muſt eat at the Lords table. But if the uncalled may not be ſealed, doth it therefore follow that the called may not be ſealed? we rather think the contrary to be conſequent.

But to ſpeak properly, men are not ſealed, but the promiſes to them, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament by ſenſible things and actions aſſures their faith, that if they believe in the death of Chriſt, they ſhall be ſaved by it, which is to them onely a conditionall ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling alſo. And then likewiſe as is their calling, ſuch will their ſealing, an externall calling takes onely the outward conditionall ſeal, an inward hath the internall and abſolute ſeale alſo. And beſide, before any come to the Supper of the Lord, he is not onely called but ſealed too, with one of the ſeals, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſme, for that ſeale hitherto they impreſſe upon all them and their children, as many as the Lord our God ſhall call, ſo that many are ſealed that have no inward call, and though upon another account, of other qualifications more requiſite to the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> then neceſſary to Baptiſme, all that are baptized do not communicate, but only thoſe who being intelligent, are capable of a Dogmaticall faith, yet formally as the Sacraments are ſeals, why any one ſhould be ſuſceptible of the one, that is not capable of the other, my ignorance cannot apprehend, and I doubt their learning cannot prompt me.</p>

Perſwaſions to mildneſs and moderation.</p>
            </argument>
            <q>
               <p>VVE firſt (though prepoſterouſly to the Roman order) brought forth our <hi>Triarii</hi> to the ſhock, and conſidered the authorities of Scripture; next we lead up our <hi>Principes,</hi> and examined the teſtimonies of the Fathers, afterward we drew out our <hi>Haſtati,</hi> and ſurveyed the force of reaſon on both ſides (though herein unſuitably alſo to the Roman diſcipline, for they put more confidence in their <hi>Principes</hi> than their <hi>Hastati,</hi> as being better men and better armed, whereas we cannot but attribute more to reaſon than any humane authority) we ſhall laſtly in the ſame unconformable method, produce our <hi>Velites,</hi> which are a <hi>militia</hi> not altogether of different kind from the former, but a lighter armature and skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhing at more diſtance.</p>
               <p>I ſhould be glad that the Architects and Modellers, or patrons and propugners of this diſcipline, would by any ſtrength of reaſon remove the prejudices which ſome prudent and moderate and godly men have concerning it, and with any clearneſs and liquidneſs of evidence ſatisfie them that there were no cauſe to doubt</p>
               <p>Firſt, Whether it ſuit with the rule of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1. <hi>Him that is weak in the faith receive you?</hi> Whether it be not a judging and ſetting at nought of thy brother, and ſo contrary to verſe 10? and whether it check not with the precept, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.3. eſteeming others better than themſelves?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whether this oeconomy that ſeemeth to hope or believe nothing, but ſuſpecteth all to be ignorant or hypocrites, and therefore of neceſſity to come to probation, reſent of that charity that <hi>hopeth, believeth all things and ſuſpecteth not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Whether it ſavour not much of the old Phariſees, (who had their name from ſeparation) <hi>touch me not, for I am bolier than thou?</hi> as if they would not touch with the rout, and it were the hazard of vitiating their pureneſs, to have a mixture with Congregations of people, that know not the Law (being ignorant) or
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:168423:167"/>break it (being unholy) or whether it reliſh not of that Phariſ's ſtanding and praying by himſelf in the parable? where <hi>Beza</hi> notes a ſingularity and ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring himſelf from the Publican, who muſt ſtand a far off and pray, which, as one ſaith, was not <hi>ſupplicatio</hi> but <hi>ſuperlatio,</hi> ſo that he turned <hi>proditor virtutis</hi> and by his pride and cenſoriouſneſs and ſingularity became worſe than the Publican, ſo verifying at laſt what he formerly ſaid, that he was not like this Publican, who was indeed better than himſelf: <hi>unaſuperbia deſtruit omnia,</hi> which occaſioned St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to ſay, <hi>Obſerve brethren that humility in evil deeds, pleaſed more than pride in well doing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Whether it ſmack of that character and qualification of the high Prieſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.2. to have compaſſion of the ignorant? <hi>Si deus benignus eſt, ut quid ſacerdos ejus auſterus? vis apparere fanctus? circa vitam tuam eſto auſterus, circa alienam benignus; nonne melius eſt propter miſericordiam rationem reddere quam propter ſeveritatem?</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>) or carry a conformity to that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and moderation of <hi>Hezechias,</hi> who prohibited not them the Paſſover, that were not cleanſed; but prayed for them, that the Lord would pardon every one that prepareth his heart to ſeek God, the Lord God of his Fathers, though he be not cleanſed according to the purification of the Sanctuary, which affection had the ſtamp and ſeal of divine approbation, for the Lord hearkened unto <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechias</hi> and healed the people, 2 <hi>Chren.</hi> 30.18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Whether it ſmell not ſtrongly of the ſpirit of <hi>Diotrepbes</hi> that ſought the preheminence, and be not a Lording it over Gods heritage? It ſeems to tend to a reducing every one to an awfull and ſervile ſubjection to his Miniſter, leſt his reputation be blaſted by being repelled from the Communion, and this is the more ſuſpected, becauſe not onely perſons which they may ſuppoſe they have cauſe to doubt to be of incompetent knowledge, muſt paſs this try'd by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, (and ſo likewiſe is it when perſons without crime and unrebukable muſt be Probationers) but generally every one, not onely ſuch of whom they might be doubtful (and yet <hi>in dubio melior eſt conditio poſſidentis bonam famam,</hi> (as I ſaid before) but thoſe of whom (ſure) there can be no ſuch violent ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, as to make the thing morally ſo much as probable, which onely (by the opinion of the Caſuiſts) may warrant ſuch a trial, but even thoſe that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance were more ſuſceptible of Catechiſing the Elders, and whoſe ſhekels are known to be double to thoſe of the Sanctuary, which makes it look more like a deſigne than duty, and may render them ſuſpected of that which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith in a caſe not unlike,

               <p>If it ſhall be replied, That perſons of conſpicuous knowledge and approved abilities are therefore called under examination to be exemplary unto others, and to prevent and remedy their oppoſition and repining at this courſe; I anſwer, That this is to make <hi>Aemilius</hi> ſuffer becauſe <hi>Rutilius</hi> hath deſerved it, to enlarge an impoſt and burden extenſively, to leſſen the ſenſe thereof intenſively, and might as well excuſe a Juſtice of Peace to require ſureties of the good behaviour of all the honeſt men in the Pariſh, leſt a ſuſpected perſon ſhould repine, whom
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:168423:167"/>he hath thought fit to bind to the good abearing, or oblige a perſon of honour patiently to ſuffer his houſe to be ſearched for ſtoln goods, and a man of unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable innocency and integrity, tamely to permit himſelf to be taken up and examined upon an hue &amp; cry for a Felon, only to be exemplary to ſuſpicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to ſubmit to, &amp; patient the ſearching of their houſes, &amp; to undergoe ſuch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and examination: In a word, it is to provoke ſome men without juſt cauſe, leſt others be irritated for doing that which, in reſpect of them, may not be unjuſt.</p>
               <p>And ſince this way is obtrued to the world under the Notion of Presbytery (which ſure is a <hi>miſnomer,</hi> for by the proper principles of that Diſcipline, it ſeems that Children onely are to paſs examination) it grieves ſome, that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage for the Presbyterial Government,

But ſurely as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid of the <hi>Mileſians,</hi> That they were not fools, but yet they did the very ſame things that fools doe; ſo if theſe be not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents, yet they have the ſame actions and wayes. There may be and are ſome differences perchance in opinion and practice between the one and the other; but that impedeth not, but that they may paſſe under one notion and denomination. The Churches of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> are in many points <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes</hi> each to other: <hi>Azorius</hi> will tell us, that what is the common opinion in the one kingdome, is not ſo in the other, (as concerning the immaculate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and the worſhipping the Croſs with <hi>Latria,</hi> &amp;c.) yet both are Papiſts, and ſo are all they among whom <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Pappus,</hi> reckons up above three hundred different opinions, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we might find far more among thoſe who properly and profeſſedly paſſe for Independents, and ſo many perchance as are not to be reduced to a fixt &amp; certain number, except by a ſecond <hi>Clavius,</hi> who hath in one ſum ſet down the number of the ſands that would fill up all the concave ſpace between the Earth and the eighth Spheare, or peradventure ſo many as there are Indulgences in that one Church of <hi>Lateran,</hi> which a Papiſt ſaith none but God can number, and he Indeed at his great day of account will be ſure to number both the one and the other.</p>
               <p>And as theſe mens ARguments are moſt of them Arrows taken out of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Quivers, and ſharpned on their Anvils, ſo let aſſay be made by ſome skilfuller hand, more verſed in theſe controverſies, whether the forces muſtred againſt ſeparation, fight not moſt of them againſt this new modell, which <hi>I</hi> know nor how to blanch or palliate with any other name than a <hi>Separation,</hi> a ſeparation of themſelves as the purer part, from the dregges of the common ſort, as if common and unclean were ſtill ſynonomous in relation to all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, for though it may differ gradually from other ſeparations, yet <hi>magis &amp; mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus non variant ſpeciem,</hi> eſpecially ſurveigh that rich Armory which St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> furniſht againſt the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> and try if moſt of his weapons may not be appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely and properly made uſe of in this preſent controverſie againſt our <hi>Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonists.</hi>

               <p>It were indeed a more humble zeale and better placed, and more diſcreetly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated, for thoſe Miniſters to engage their endeavours to frame and conſtitute their ſeveral Towns and Pariſhes according to the way of Presbyterial Churches, where they have a more warrantable call, where their ſpeciall work lies, and where they receive their maintenance, and to take heed to thoſe Flocks whereof the holy Ghoſt hath made them over-ſeers, rather than to be gathering and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming (without obligation or warrant) of new Churches out of Churches, of ſuch perſons as by remoteneſs of place are not ſuſceptible of any frequent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion together in the miniſtry of the word, and have one paſtor for the Word, another for the Sacraments, at leaſt if any body can tell who is the Paſos of ſome of thoſe Churches, in which are ſo many Miniſters, that have ſeverall paſtorall charges elſewhere, and ſome other of theſe (in like manner) gathered Churches, who have ſtept farther, and ſtand at greater diſtance in their ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

And I would have thoſe that are lawfully ordained Miniſters, abſtracted from Selfe and Intereſt, (for <hi>peſſimum veri affectus venenum ſua cuique utilitas,</hi>) to conſider with what right they can take tythes from them whom they will not own to be of their Church, &amp; ſeeing <hi>officium &amp; beneficium ſunt relata,</hi> with what conſcience they can exact the whole tyth as their due, when they omit a great part of their duty?

               <p>Laſtly, I ſhall hold it forth to the ſerious conſideration of prudentiall and godly men, whether this ſetting of the Sacraments in an elevation of purity and holineſſe above the Word, as a lower and higher ſtory, or ſphear, have not been the ſpring or ſource of thoſe manifold ſchilmes and hereſies which of late years have made the Church of God as an heap of ſand, without unity or commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and whether that opinion haue not been fomented by an ambition of pre-eminence of power in ſome men, and ſingularity of holineſs in others.</p>

And <hi>Cajetan</hi> tells us, that if we think an action evill, not for the intent of the actor, but abſolutely becauſe ſuch an act is evill in its kind, that judgement reſpects not perſons but things, whereof we are to judge according to what they ſeem to be; and though ſome of his wayes are not warrantable, yet a man may be denominated good, though checked with ſome evill actions, as we ſay the Moon ſhines when a good part thereof is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned; and that it is bright when yet it is blemiſhed with ſome ſpots; and that it is round when notwithſtanding not onely the perſpectives but other obſervations ſhew that it is indented with gibbous and hollow parts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is a ſuſpition of ſuch a fault as themſelves have publickly taught us is one of the ſpots of Gods children: for ſuch they ſay are pride (together with anger and worldlineſs) though ſome did think they were not duly cautious to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine and limit thoſe ſpots, ſo as might farther tempt ſome to a ſuſpitious inquiry, whether as that famous Carver formed <hi>Iupiter</hi> to the ſimilitude of his own <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> and the Negroes depaint Angels to their proper colour, and they ſay, if a beaſt could limb God himſelf, he would draw him according to his ſhape, as ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious men alſo doe: ſo in determining what ſpots might be compatible with the beauty of holineſs, they ſelected ſuch as perchance might be viſible in their own faces.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, though they be ſuſpected, yet they are not ſuſpended, nor thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be ſo: ſuſpition that leads onely to admonition may be charitable, when that which is carried on to ſuſpenſion may be Phariſaicall; as <hi>Galvano</hi> tells us of a tree in <hi>India,</hi> the one ſide whereof, which reſpects the Eaſt, is antidote, and that which looks to the Weſt is poyſon: and as the Dates in Egypt which ripened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond ſuch an hight, inebriate, but are otherwiſe wholſome. 'Tis ſuch a ſuſpition as a Phyſician may have that obſerving the ſymptoms warns of the diſeaſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade to uſe of remedies; not ſuch as the Spaniards had towards their ſlaves, who when through faintneſs they could not anſwer expectation, they ſtraight knockt them in the heads, to prevent more trouble with them: 'tis like <hi>bath col</hi> or the <hi>filia vocis</hi> among the later Jewes, which though it came with thunder, yet it was alwayes for inſtruction, and never attended with a thunder-bolt.</p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:168423:186"/>
               <p>Fifthly, all of this way are not ſuſpected to walk with the ſame affections, there are ſome haply who (as <hi>Whitaker</hi> was wont to ſay of <hi>Bernard</hi>) doe follow <hi>Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom</hi> with a ſimple heart. <hi>Finis operis &amp; finis operantis</hi> are not alwayes concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick: there are ſome callings which <hi>ſonant in malum, &amp; vergunt in malum,</hi> yet ſome men haply contract not all the evils whereunto all callings are a tentation, and wherewith many are enſnared that manage them; the grapes may be ſoure, yet all teeth may not be ſet on edge with them: And howſoever a good intention cannot make that to commence good, which in the kind and object is evill, as an evill end or efficient vitiates that which is in its proper nature good; yet the actors of that evill may not all have the ſame impulſives and affections, and therefore it may have divers accidentall qualifications and degrees. When the Donatiſts propt up their hereſie with the authority of <hi>Cyprian, Lyrinenſis</hi> tells them, that the authors of the opinions are judged Catholiques, but the followers thereof are Hereticks; the Maſters are pardoned, but the Scholars condemned. But peradventure we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertedly ſay, that the firſt projectors and prime leaders are more culpable than thoſe that take after them, who in the mixture and compounding of this diſcipline may have added ſome ingredients and infuſions, which to the others are not diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. It is an happy ignorance in thoſe of ſhallow judgments, that they know not theſe depths. <hi>Clavius</hi> hath demonſtrated, that in a man walking, his head moves fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter than his feet. The ſuperiors and maſters have farther reatches &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehenſions than thoſe of lower form, and the chief heads goe farther than others follow, and there may be implicite Phariſaiſme where is no explicite; as thoſe charmers who undertook to cure diſtempers by words, or by ſuch applications as have no naturall influence upon the effect, are therein ſucceſsfull onely by a compact with the Divel, yet the moſt of thoſe that practiſe this ſorcery know nothing of this covenant, yet proceeding in that way and method which by the firſt contract being uſed in order to thoſe ends, the effect followeth by the operation of Satan, and therefore they are ſaid to work by an implicite compact.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Jerom</hi> tells the Pelagians they are worſe than the Phariſee, for he gave God thanks, which they ſeemed not to doe. And Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> puts the ſame on their ſcore, becauſe they aſcribe to their proper ſtrength that good which the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee attributed to the favour of God.</p>
               <p>Some of our Divines, (and particularly <hi>Humfries</hi> and <hi>Gerhard</hi>) have laid the Phariſee at the dore of the Papiſts:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phariſaiſm. vetus &amp; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus, loc. com. tom.</hi> 5. <hi>ſect.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 393.</note> yet <hi>Pelagius</hi> (they ſay) was otherwiſe a man of an humble ſpirit, and if he were not, yet I am perſwaded that many both among the Remonſtrants, and the Papiſts, who have been ſoured with this leaven, have not much ſwoln therewith, and are Phariſees not without that righteouſneſs wherewith they may enter the kingdome of heaven. As <hi>Bibliander</hi> ſaid of <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> his <hi>Enchiridion,</hi> there was more devotion in the book than in the Author; ſo ſometimes alſo there may be pride in the opinion, which hath no influx or diffuſion into the perſon.</p>
               <p>And therefore when they ſay, 'tis poſſible their actings <hi>may as well preceed from the tenderneſs of their conſciences, and love of holineſſe, as an over-weening conceit of their own pureneſſe, and that they are perſwaded a man may be humble, and yet wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in his ſociety in Gods Ordinance:</hi> we ſhall concede it is poſſible, and it may be actually ſo in ſome, but we cannot be perſwaded that it is therefore conſequent hat it is ſo in all: for the argument follows not <hi>à poſſe ad eſſe.</hi> Its poſſible the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:168423:187"/>
                  <hi>Mileſians</hi> may be no fools, yet they doe the very ſame things which fools commonly doe, and if they be not ſick of ſuch a malady, the ſymptom belies the diſeaſe, 'Tis poſſible that <hi>Alpheus,</hi> one river among a thouſand, may paſs from <hi>Elis</hi> under the earth and ſea unmixt to <hi>Arethuſa</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and the <hi>Danow</hi> and <hi>Savus</hi> may ſtream together in one chanel, without blending of their waters; but he that ſhall ſuſpect the contrary of all other rivers, will rather aſſert the ſtrength of his reaſon, than betray the weakneſs of his faith.</p>
               <p>But would not this Apology have ſuited with as much handſomneſs, and ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with as great grace in the mouth of the Phariſee? (which indeed ſeems to be of purpoſe fitted for him;) Might not he have asked why his complacency in not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as other men, might not have proceeded from an heart raiſed up in thankfulneſs to God who had made him to differ, as well as from a ſpirit lift up in pride? <hi>(Proditio eſt ea tacere quae quis ſtudiosè perfecerit.)</hi> That his ſcoring up his good works might have flowed as well from a deſire to have advanced the honor of God, that men by ſeeing his good works, might have glorified his Father in heaven, and to have excited them to imitate his example, as from an affection to make ſome ſacrifice to oſtentation,

It is great pitie that the Phariſee had not retained ſuch an Advocate, or found out ſuch a plea; perhaps he had then never been caſt at his arraignment, <hi>ſi
<q>—Tali auxilio &amp; defenſoribus iſtis</q> non eguiſſet.</hi> But with what parget ſoever men may daub, or w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> what colour they may depaint thoſe things, ſeriouſly when we pleaſe our ſelves too much, we pleaſe God nothing; even in this, his wayes are not like our wayes, we condemne our ſelves, he acquits us, and condemns us when we applaud our ſelves; not onely other mens eyes, but our own as much, are <hi>latrones praemioru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> And as they ſay Hunters lay glaſſes for the Panther, that ſtaying to behold himſelf in them, they may the better over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take and deſtroy him: ſo he that knows that the contemplation of his own excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency with too great complacency was that which caſt him down from heaven, uſeth the ſame ſnare as moſt effectuall to intangle others. And to deſpiſe our brethren in our eyes, makes us moſt deſplcable in the ſight of God: in other things we ought to imitate God, but in this he imitates us, &amp; in this reſpect is made in the likeneſs of Men. <hi>Facilius parcit his qui in ipſum offendunt quàm qui in proximum,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome.</hi> Lines the neerer they approach the center, come the neerer to each other, and they are at greateſt diſtance from God, who are fartheſt off from each other in pride and uncharitableneſs.</p>
               <p>But neither is the beam ſo upright between tenderneſs of conſcience and love of holineſs, and an over-weening conceit of pureneſſe, or betwixt humility and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs in ſociety in Gods ordinance, as that a caſt of charity may turn the ſcale to to the better part. Conſcience (ſaith <hi>Aquinas</hi>) is the order or application of our Science to ſomewhat, or (it being to be taken intranſitively) our ſcience or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge applied to particular acts: but truly we have yet ſeen no ſcientificall demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations for this way, which may beget ſuch a firm and certain aſſent to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or truth thereof: <hi>ex mero motu</hi> it may be, but not <hi>ex certa ſcientia;</hi> and what
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:168423:187"/>principle ſoever it be, that directs our actions in good or evill, if it have not the force of ſome law juſtly obligatory, whereof it is but the cryer or proclaimer, it is not conſcience, but fancy it may be (which is an irrationall animall conſcience, fancy in bruit creatures being (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> tells us) that which ſupplies the place of reaſon) or humor it may be (and then according to the Hebrew proverb, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it is <hi>Leah,</hi> or conſonantly to the Greek, it is to court the maid in ſtead of <hi>Penelope</hi>) or paſſion it may be (and that is, as in an Aegyptian Temple, a beaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Deity.</p>
               <p>We doubt if that be true which they ſay, <hi>That in Peru is a plant called Drakena, whoſe root is alexi-pharmacous, and the leaves venemous;</hi> but it is impoſſible that ſo ſweet a root as conſcience and love of holineſs, ſhould give ſpring to ſo bitter and intoxicating a fruit as Separation.

But as it was the law of <hi>Pittacus,</hi> That he which offended in his drunkenneſs ſhould ſuffer double puniſhment, one for his offence, and another for his drunkenneſs: ſo it ſeems as rationall, that he that perpetrates any fault by an erroneous conſcience, which is a ſpirituall drunkenneſs, ſhould incurre a twofold penalty, one for his error, another for the fault: but however, if it dee not aggravate the evill, yet error in the conſcience cannot make the matter commence good: For every vincible error is voluntary, and he acts imprudently that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it, and he that is imprudent is not good; and that an action be good, the cauſe ought to be integrous, but the cauſe cannot be intire although the object be apprehended as good, but it is alſo neceſſary that in the underſtanding there be an integrous reaſon of the apprehenſion of it as good, that is, that it be judged good in the underſtanding, and that in no manner it may be judged, or ought to be judged evill, which cannot be as long as the error is voluntary, becauſe vincible.</p>

So the Apologiſts will have us believe, that the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have ſcored and beaten out this way before them, as their guides, or to ſtand as <hi>Mercuries</hi> to point them to it.

               <p n="2">2.

But as things written with Allom water, are to be read onely when the paper is heated by the fire: ſo the fire of trouble would give ſome light to foreſtall the beams of the Sun, and we might then find ſome to be Phariſees, Sichemites, that are ſuch onely for the advantage of the times, who like the <hi>herba mimoſa</hi> do ſend forth their bloſſoms but in the eye of the Sun, &amp; ſhed them when he withdraws his light; or like the <hi>Heliotrope,</hi> which expands &amp; turns her ſelf always towards the Sun, &amp; cloſeth at his ſetting.

                  <hi>To keep away ignorant and ſcandalous perſons, exceeds not Miniſteriall power, is no Lording imperious thing.</hi> But firſt, were they whom they keep away ſuch delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, yet the number of the guilty ſhould manacle the hands of the Judge, and <hi>periculum ſchiſmatis</hi> ſend an injunction from the Court of equity. If the one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber be gangrened, the exciſion thereof may be juſt and neceſſary, <hi>potiùs pereat unus quàm unitas,</hi> (as <hi>Bernard</hi>) but if the body be infected with a ſcab, other medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines may be applied without diſ-joynting or diſſecting the whole. They plead for Miniſteriall power which they have as governors of their Churches, and we ſhould check the thoughts (if any could ariſe in us) that ſhould oppoſe or repine at it, while it is regular and limited, and while the head doth not drop acrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous defluxions to emaciate and waſt the body, for then <hi>caput malum eſt caput mali,</hi> and the head is the parent of all diſeaſes, as Phyſicians ſay. <hi>Defer Deo in nobis, &amp; deferemus Deo in te,</hi> as <hi>Symmachus</hi> in <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> But as <hi>Furfidius</hi> counſelled <hi>Sylla, Sinendos eſſe aliquos vivere ut eſſent quibus poſſet imperare,</hi> ſo they ſhould not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church ſo many that they might have ſome to govern; and as he ſaid in the patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of women, though they could not live ſo contentedly with them as was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, yet without them they could not live at all: ſo though their Church ſhould be leſſe pure by the communion of thoſe they reject, yet it will be ſcarce a Church without them, and the ſpirits which they ſhall extract by ſeparation, will not quit the coſt of the turning of ſo huge a ſubſtance to <hi>caput mortuum;</hi> and if we ſhould grant their ſeparations could produce gold, yet it muſt needs fare with them as <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> tells us it did with <hi>Caligula, Invitaverat ſpes Caium principem avidiſſimum auri, quamobrem juſſit excoqui magnum pondus, &amp; planè fecit aurum excellens ſed ita parvi ponderis ut detrimentum ſentiret, — nec poſtea tentatum ab ullo eſt.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, to whom are they ſcandalous? Some four or five are ſcandalized by four or five hundred, for about that proportion their Church bears to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:168423:194"/>and thoſe hundreds are more ſcandalized by their ſeparation, then the units can be by their comportment or condition. <hi>Quos projecerunt video, quos unuerunt ipſi dicant,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to his <hi>Donatiſts.</hi> Theſe centuries were never judicially caſt out, but ſeparated from, and how could they regularly be caſt forth, when the reſt are hardly members enough to conſtitute and organize the Body? They were rather the Body of the Church from which the ſeparation was made, the denomination being taken from the major part, and what <hi>Livy</hi> ſaith in another caſe is appliable to this, <hi>In duas partes diſceſſit civitas, aliud integer po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulus, fautor et cultor bonorum, aliud forenſis factio tenebat,</hi>

The Nations are given to Chriſt for an inheritance, you would appropriate it to your party, Quaſi propter vos Chriſtus apud nos haereditatem perdidcrit ſuam.</hi> Philoſophers ſay, <hi>Omnis motus eſt ſuper immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bili:</hi> that was the Church rather which ſtirred not, when they moved a way in their ſeparation, not that which removed, and they were the whole, the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts but a part; and though one member may be cut off to preſerve the whole, yet it is a wild and deſperate way of cure to diſſect the whole to conſerve a part.

               <p>But why ſhould it be odious in us to propound ſuch an <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> when they acknowledge that it is poſſible that the Paſtor may be exceeded in learning and gifts by ſome of his Congregation, and themſelves make an oſtent of an example of one that confeſt he had need to be taught of an eminent perſon under him, which I hope was neither lying humility, nor complementall hypocriſie, onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance they may be of like mind with Cardinal <hi>Langius,</hi> that what <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid was true, but it was not to be ſuffered that ſuch a fellow as he ſhould have to doe with it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the alluſion,</hi> they ſay, <hi>every one ſees reflects on the particular Miniſters;</hi> rather
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:168423:205"/>none can ſee it, not thoſe to whom it is viſible that thoſe Miniſters fall ſhort of the parts of ſome of their congregations, none but only they to whom my breſt is dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous and my heart tranſparent, but from my herat I profeſſe that without any ſuch reflex I writ Mathematically, and abſtracted my lines from all ſubjects: but if they will needs have an inherence to be of the eſſence of this accident, and that this muſt needs referre and be reſtrained to certain particular perſons, and they will rack me to confeſſe what I ſhould be contented to conceale, I ſhall yet onely ſay, that ſuch a reflection had been no ſuch hainous or piacular offence, and that the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> (as I meant it though they will perforce make it a <hi>Theſis</hi>) is as farre from diſparagement as impoſſibility. He that by diſcourſe hath poyſed and ſelt the weight of their Shekels will be eaſie to believe, that no great maſs need to be laid in the counter-ſcales to ballance them, that ſome common Shekels may aequiponderate the moſt of them, and ſome perchance may need their allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſome grains to make them paſſe the Standard of the Sanctuary. And if in any degree they ſhall be madded at this, ſure it is not over-much learning that makes them mad. But be their Shekels whatſoever, yet let them be like thoſe old Iſraelitiſh coins, which had on one ſide ſtamped the pot of Manna, as well as on the other <hi>Aarons</hi> rod bloſſoming, whereas they are all for the one, and forget the other.</p>
               <p>We run in confort with them, while they ſing <hi>that not the largeſt Shekels,</hi> (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they mean for extent of knowledge) <hi>BUT THE HOLIEST are beſt,</hi> for we preferre the tree of life before that of knowledge, ſince the one alwayes makes to live for ever, the other ſometime caſts out of Paradiſe. But though Gold be more pretious than other metals, yet Iron is more regardable at a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and when men are examined whether they be ignorant, knowledge is that which is chiefly looked after. And ſo alſo though in the definition of an Orator, <hi>vir bonus</hi> be a better attribute then <hi>dicendi peritus,</hi> yet that which is proper and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall to a good Orator, is to be skilfull in the Art of ſpeaking, &amp;c. And ſo it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe conſtitutive of a good Miniſter to have his Shekel of full weight as well as of pure metall, and to be learned as well as godly.</p>
               <p>And what they ſay, <hi>That knowledge adorned with humility, and engaged to advance piety, of any what ever meaſure or extent, is after the Standard of the Sanctuary,</hi> is not true, if applied to a Miniſter, for as <hi>Gregory</hi> pithily, He that is the Paſtor ought ſo far to excell his flock generally, as compared with him, they may ſeem but of the herd; the Well ſhould be of more capacity than the Bucket, and for the ſheep it is enough to drink there, but <hi>Jacob</hi> ought to be of greater ſtrength to remove the ſtone, and open the well, (according to <hi>Origens</hi> allegory) but if in themſelves or others ſo few grains of knowledge may make up a Shekel of a paſſable weight, why are they ſo rigid at other times in the tryall thereof in their Scales? and whereas they require that knowledge be adorned wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h humility, and engaged to advance piety, we ſhal ſo far ſecond them, as to confeſſe that where there is a weighty Shekel, it depreſſeth the ſcale, and ſets it lower, and alſo that all the gold and ſilver which hath been brought out of Egypt, and all the Ear-rings (what ever the ear hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) ought to be ſubſervient to the building of the Tabernacle, and no Shekels (as too many are) ſhould be (like thoſe of <hi>Micah</hi>) converted to the making of a <hi>Teraphim,</hi> but we cannot conſent, that onely that piety is pure and paſſable metall, which hath the touch of the Tower which they are building, or is currant coyn which hath their ſtamp and mintage, or that as Eagles are tryed by
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:168423:205"/>looking againſt the Sun, ſo that it is onely genuine piety which can endure their new light.</p>
               <p>To that of the paper, That to ſuſpect the knowledge of the generality of their people, is to imply (as the Papiſts have abuſively perverted that of <hi>Gregory</hi>) that while the Oxen laboured, they were all Aſſes that fed by them, they anſwer, <hi>They need a paire of tongs to deal with ſo odicus a compariſon.</hi> And perchance they need them indeed, leſt it be felt ſo hot as to burn their fingers; but if <hi>non dico nugas eſſe, ſed eſſe puto,</hi> if they doe not expreſsly call them Aſſes, as they implicitly call them Dogs and Swine, which is worſe, yet virtually and practically they judge them ſuch, and deale with them as if they were no other, and make them ſuch by an interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative declaring them to be ſo (as in common acception they are ſaid to make a man a foole that uſe him as if he were one, as alſo <hi>magnifacere</hi> is but <hi>magnum dicore;</hi>) for if they think them to be of knowledge and underſtanding, why do they doubtingly examine them? Who enquires after that whereof he is already ſatisfied? if they ſuppoſe there is reaſon to bring them under ſuch a ſuſpitious tryall, then they are not perſwaded but that they are (at leaſt may be) theſe ſimple ones whereof the Aſſe is the hieroglyphick, and if they did not imply them to be Aſſes, they yet hold forth themſelves as Lyons, that will have all beaſts of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, others as well as Aſſes to proſtrate themſelves in ſuch obeyſance. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance the quarrell may be, that as the Pope ſaid of <hi>England, Etiam aſinus meus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calcitrat;</hi> ſo the Aſſe will no longer lye down under his burden, and ſure as it is ſaid, nothing will hold the water of <hi>Styx,</hi> that perforates all other things, ſave the hoofe of an Aſſe; ſo perhaps it may be well ſuppoſed, that this doctrine of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to their trials can be onely proper to thoſe whom they ſuppoſe that animall may emblem.</p>

               <p>But we ſay not that their way (though the corruption of Presbytery) carries an omnimodous or multifarious ſimilitude with Popery, ſo as that

The unchurching of ſo many, and ſeparating from them, may tempt men into a facility of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to that Church, which ſeems to have a larger and a gender boſome, as in a beſieged town the ſcarcity of victuals conſtrains ſome to eat unwholſome food, and prompts others to be fugitives into the enemies quarters, where they are like to find a more favourable reception &amp; a freer communion. I pray God their keyes do not help to open the pit for ſmoak to ariſe, and out of the ſmoak thoſe Locuſts the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits to come amongſt us: for as perſons of honor and integrity have undertaken to aſſure the world, that actually divers Jeſuits have paſſed incontroulably under the mask and notion of Independents, ſo it is obvious to any that probably it may be ſo; for Independency is an apt diſguiſe for a Jeſuite, ſince he that takes on this Livery, may under that Cloak ſuit himſelf with other clothes for ſtuff and

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:168423:209"/>talk with a fervent zeal, but are as incompetent to carry on the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and ſettlement, as he was to accompliſh the deliverance of the Jewes.</p>
               <p>Or thirdly, perchance that ſum which they caſt up to be unfit, were indeed not fit for their ſpurious and ſuppoſitious Presbytery, and unfit for their ends and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, who would approve of, or like none that were not like thoſe in <hi>Tacitus, Qui veri copiam non faciunt, ſed ſuſpenſa &amp; quo ducuntur inclinantia reſpondent,</hi> and none to act as Church Governors which would not in acting be governed by them as the prime agents, and were unwilling to ſet up any Oracles that would not <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippize,</hi> and ſought to have no planets in the Spheares that will not move con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrick with them as the Sun, and receive all their light from them, and if not like <hi>Mercury</hi> that ſhewes himſelfe but once in thirty yeares, yet like the other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets when they are in a Diametrall line with the Sun to ſeem retrograde, and give place and way to him; for thoſe whom they aſſume to aſſiſt in the work, they called with the ſame intent, with which <hi>Xerxes</hi> convened the Lords of <hi>Aſia</hi> when he deſigned the invaſion of <hi>Greece,</hi> to give more luſter and countenance alone (as he ſaid) to the expedition, and onely to obey and not to adviſe him.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AS <hi>Arminius</hi> thought it a good <hi>Quaere</hi> why Semipelagianiſme might not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted true Chriſtianiſme, becauſe if that were falſe and counterfet coin, Arminianiſme could not be currant, both being of like metall though of different ſtamp: ſo the Apologiſts having generally been willing to paſſe under the vizard of Presbytery, yet being reſearched, &amp; like to be detected for Independents, when they can no longer keep on the mask, they ſeem to own the face, at leaſt ſuppoſe it need not be diſowned, and tell us, <hi>That Independents are no ſuch formidable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to them.</hi>

               <p>Firſt, and to them indeed they need not ſeem fearfull,
<q>Cognatis maculis parcit fera,</q> And <hi>Junius</hi> tells us out of <hi>Pliny. Animantia in ſuo genere probe degunt, congregari videmus &amp; ſtarc contra diſſimilia,

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, they are not ſo formidable indeed to any as the Spaniards were to the Indians, that they could not think it an happineſſe to go to heaven in their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, nor to conſort with them in any good way that leads thither.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, neither are they ſo terrible at any Scholaſtick encounter, as that if
<q>— Criſpinus minimo me provocat.</q> none ſhould dare with them
<q>— tentare peri ula belli;</q> Or that their names like <hi>Warwicks</hi> at the battell of <hi>Banbury,</hi> ſhould ſtrike terror enough to win a victory; but I doubt when the light of truth ſhall hereafter aſcend neerer to her meridian, and diſpell theſe miſts which now hinder men to ſee clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they will ſeem
<q>Nomina quae ipſo ſunt pene tremenda ſono.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Many godly men,</hi> ſay they, <hi>lye under that diſtinction of judgement,</hi> and I wiſh it were onely a diſtinction without a difference.</p>
               <p>But firſt, I doubt the Independents will account this <hi>opprobrii loco,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>frigida &amp; tenuis laudatio:</hi> for all of that denomination muſt needs be very godly, who uſurp that definition for their way, which the Chymiſts arrogate to their Art, <hi>puri ab impuro ſeparatio.</hi> As all that fire which is ſpheared on high and ſeparate from commixture, is a pure element; ſo their Churches are queſtionleſſe pure and clear like <hi>Egypts</hi> sky, and have not a black cloud in them, and <hi>Adam</hi> in them ſeems not to have ſinned.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, if we take Independencie in the lump, not in ſome parcels that may be extracted, and take the denomination from the major part, the notion of <hi>Godly</hi> and <hi>Independent</hi> are not onely at diſtance, but Diametral oppoſition: for as in tempering medicines, there is ſomwhat which they call the <hi>Baſis,</hi> whereunto they add other ingredients that have their ſeveral qualities and operations: ſo Independency is the <hi>Baſis</hi> of moſt modern hereſies, and the fertill <hi>Africa</hi> of theſe Monſters. And as <hi>ubi definit Philoſophus incipit medicus:</hi> ſo where Independency ends, there other hereſies begin, who are generally <hi>Independents, &amp; aliquid amplius,</hi> and as after the battell of <hi>Salamis,</hi> in honor of the victory, every man gave the ſecond place to <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> though he named himſelf firſt; ſo if one be an <hi>Antinomian,</hi> another a <hi>Socinian,</hi> another an <hi>Antiſcripturiſt,</hi> yet every one is an Independent, that as <hi>Pacianus</hi> ſaid, <hi>Chriſtianus mihi nomen, Catholicus cognomen, illud me nuncu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pat, iſtud oſtendit;</hi> ſo Independent is the <hi>praenomen,</hi> what ever be the <hi>agnomen</hi> of hereticks.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, but I cannot truly deny, nor ſhall unwillingly grant, that there are ſome godly men of that notion, yet though I ſhall not ſay as <hi>Vopiſcus</hi> relates it was ſaid of good Princes, <hi>In uno annulo poſſe praeſcribi &amp; depingi; at contrà quae ſeries malorum?</hi> nor altogether with <hi>Eubulus</hi> the Comicall Poet that checkt himſelfe for declaiming againſt wom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n, for if this were naught, yet that was not good; but ſoon found, himſelf at a ſtand, not being able to find more of the good, but multitudes of the evill, yet I believe thoſe godly men are
<q>Rari nantes in gurgite vaſto,</q> Like the Iſraelites, as two little flocks of Kids, but the contrary kind like the <hi>Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> fill the Countrey.</p>
               <p>And then 4ly, it was no great honor to <hi>Sodom</hi> that one <hi>Lot</hi> was their Citizen,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:168423:210"/>there are ſome white men among the <hi>Negroes,</hi> yet is that the land of Blackmoores. Even Mercury, a deſperate poyſon, hath ſome parts which being ſeparated from the whole, are Antidote.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, Thoſe purely meer Independents which have no mixture of other here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies or prophaneſs, and are godly men, yet their light doth not ſhine ſo bright, that as in the Sun thoſe leſſer ſtarrs that move about him do ſeem as ſpots, ſo their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs ſhould be defiled by a communion with others leſs holy; neither are they like the Sun which by his matchleſs light perſtringeth and eclipſeth all other ſtarrs and attracts all eyes upon his pearleſs beauty. Their godlineſs may onely be an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology for their ſtation and immunity, as <hi>Photius</hi> tells us, that thoſe which made <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſius</hi> a Biſhop before he believed the reſurrection, made this defence for ſo doing, that they found many excellent graces in him, and that they could not but think them uſeful to the Church of God, and hope that God would not let them all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, as ſome of them are purged from filthineſs of the fleſh, ſo I wiſh they were alſo as much from that of the ſpirit, and were holy as well in ſpirit as in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; yet as hereſie, ſo ſchiſme is ranked alſo among the works of the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20. where if it ſtand not under the notion of hereſie, (as indeed <hi>Tremelius</hi> out of the <hi>Syrivck</hi> reads <hi>Schiſmes</hi> where we do <hi>Hereſies,</hi> and betwixt theſe two there is ſuch an affinity and complicition as betwixt the <hi>Midiauites</hi> and <hi>Iſhmaelites,</hi> that one is taken for another, or each intermixt with other, and Schiſme ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> is ſometime called Hereſie, not that it is Hereſie but becauſe it diſpoſeth to it,) yet it falls under this comprehenſion of variance, emulations, wrath, ſtrife, &amp;c. and as Schiſme ſprings from pride, and an overweening conceit of themſelves as the efficient, whereof the <hi>ſignum pathognomonicum</hi> is a faſtidious contempt of others, ſo the impulſive thereof <hi>Gerſon</hi> tells us what it is, <hi>propter quaeſtum &amp; propter vanam gloriam,</hi> ſutably to that whereby <hi>Auguſtine</hi> defines an Heretick, <hi>qui alicujus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modi temporalis &amp; maximè gloriae principa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And therefore what ever may be ſaid of the godlineſs of Independents, yet ſince they cannot well traverſe or plead not guilty to an indictment of Schiſme, I think as the <hi>Greek</hi> proverb ſaith, That a good Goat, a good Cat, &amp;c. are bad beaſts, ſo the beſt Independent is in this reſpect evill,

               </p>
               <p>But <hi>diſſentiunt inter ſe, contra unitatem omnes conſentiunt,</hi> (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> of his <hi>Donatiſts,</hi>) <hi>they ſee ſome imperfection in the Independant way,</hi> (and they ſee very little that diſcerne not much imperfection therein,) <hi>and they know not their own to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:168423:210"/>be altogether free,</hi> (and how can the ſtream be clear when the ſpring is corrupt?) the one and the other are paralel wayes, trodden out by the ſame line, and leading down the ſame precipice, and diffet but as <hi>iter, actus</hi> &amp; <hi>via</hi> in the Law, the one is a little larger and more extenſive than the other, there may be ſome little diſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction but no materiall difference between them ſave in this onely, that the one Baptize the Infants of thoſe that are not of their Churches, which the others deny to do. They here acknowledge, <hi>they agree in the greater and differ but in the leſſe things,</hi> which I think may be reſtrained and limitted to diſcipline eſpecially, and they confeſſe both parties <hi>to have the ſelf ſame intereſt,</hi> or rather it ſhould be, <hi>the ſame ſelf intereſt;</hi> and therefore when they accuſe the Independent way of Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<q>In tabulam Syllaejam dicunt diſcipuli tres:</q> and as we ſee it truth which <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith, <hi>ut oculus, ſic animus Je non videns alia cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit;</hi> ſo it is as true that they are dimme and decaying eyes which can better diſcerne things at ſome diſtance than nearer hand, and apprehend other mens imperfections more clearly than their own. And if they know not their own way to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther free from imperfections, why can they not patiently abide to hear that which may make them know it to be imperfect? how do they ſo confidently aſſert that way, <hi>&amp; in malis ſuis defenſionis fomitem quaerunt,</hi> as <hi>Gregory</hi> ſpeaks? <hi>Non ſemper corrupta eſt mens male operantis ſed emper corrupta male deſendentis:</hi> wherefore ſo violently enforce it, unleſs as the <hi>Pope</hi> ſaid he would write <hi>Fiatur</hi> in deſpight of <hi>Grammer,</hi> ſo they will have a <hi>Fiat</hi> for their imperfect modell in defiance of truth, and uſupre a like power to that which <hi>Stapleton</hi> arrogates to the Church, that even fabulous and apocryphal things, by their authority may become canonical?</p>
               <p>But the imperfection is ſcored up <hi>upon their inability to do more, their reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being not the meaſure of their will, but their power.</hi> Although they otherwhere left weightier things untoucht, yet in the 17. <hi>Sect.</hi> they cannot let a ſcruple paſſe without handling the poyſe thereof; but however careful they be of weight, they are injurious of meaſure, or elſe they would never have ſaid their reformation was not the meaſure of their will but power: Though they may ſuppoſe themſelves ſo pure as neceſſarily to be ſeparate from the common Maſſe, yet their language is not pure from impropriety. But not to run deſcant in ſo poor a ditty, I ſuppoſe they would have ſaid paſſively, their reformation is not meaſured by, or is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of their will, but their power, and perchance ſhould more truly have ſaid, their will ſeconded with their power is the meaſure of their refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. But if they are conſcious that they ought to do otherwiſe than they have done, but cannot do it, then they ſhould have ſaid they knew that their way is not free from imperfection, not that they knew it not to be free. But as it impreſſeth wonder to hear that their reformation is meaſured by their power not their will, ſince it is with them as the wanton <hi>Emproſſe</hi> ſaid to her luſtful Son in law, <hi>quic quid libet licet,</hi> ſo it ſtrikes fear to conſider it, ſeeing they have power enough to receed and remit ſomewhat of their rigor, and if they want power to carry it higher, and go further, then we are in a ſad caſe that are ſecured onely by that which kept the Chriſtians (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> tells us) from depoſing heathen Emperours, <hi>quia de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuere vires.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They next ſet forth their <hi>Eirenicon,</hi> and firſt wiſh an accommodation between them and their dear brethren of the riged Independency. But they agree too well al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready to divide and rent the Church, for as the peace of Hereticks is the warre of the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:168423:211"/>Church, &amp; the war of the one the peace of the other; ſo the <hi>Ceraunia</hi> of our quietneſs might be bred in the midſt of their thundrings one againſt another, &amp; we ſhall leſs fear and better deal with their rods and axes if they were ſingle and not in a bundle.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They profeſſe what they would do <hi>propter unitatem Donati,</hi> that will do ſo little <hi>propter unitatem Chriſti, they would go many miles barefoot, to meet peace with them,</hi> but I wiſh they would go with their feet ſhod with the preparation of peace toward their people.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, They give their ſenſe of the calamitous conſequences of the diſcords in the Church, and we are as conſcious, <hi>diſſidia noſtra ſunt amicorum diſpendia, hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um compendia,</hi> (as <hi>Hierom</hi>) <hi>&amp; publica irae divinae incendia,</hi> as <hi>Junius,</hi> and to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate an harmony between them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, They propound the opinion of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in ſome branches (it ſeem; ſome others of them bear ſuch fruit as ſet their teeth on edge:) what paſſage they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon I cannot divine, the page quoted by them having nothing of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment in that laſt edition, but to make even with them, I ſhall deſire them to peruſe and perpend what is formerly cited, and which he delivers in his <hi>Saints ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Reſt,</hi> Part 321.

Let the Independents returne to them, not they turn to thoſe, nor to be like <hi>Piſiſtratus</hi> the tyrant of <hi>Athens,</hi> who when ſome of his party had revolted and fortified <hi>Phyle</hi> againſt him, he came to them with his baggage, and profeſſed that if he could not perſwade them to return to him, he was reſolved to abide with them. I know not whether it gives impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of more wonder or indignation to ſee old Tragaedies once played between the <hi>Orthodoxe</hi> and <hi>Arians</hi> acted over again, under other names and in another Scene, whereas at the Councils of <hi>Ariminum</hi> and <hi>Seleucia,</hi> the worſe and leſſer party outwitted and overacted the better &amp; greater, and they that at firſt pretended onely to deſire Churches for themſelves, grew at length to that powerful inſolence to deny them to others. And as much ingratitude is obſervable in it, that thoſe which like the Ivy grew up by embracing the tree, ſhould exhauſt the ſapp and ſtrength thereof, and like Quickſilver ſhould eat out and conſume the mettal they cloſed with; ſo perchance ſomewhat of juſtice may be conſiderable therein, that as it was ſaid of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France,</hi> That he fell by that Religion to which
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:168423:211"/>he fell; ſo all the compliances of the one party have onely occaſioned them to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from thoſe whom they have too indulgently ſuffered: and as when that King was wounded in the mouth by <hi>Caſtel,</hi> he receaved an admonition, That having denied the truth with his mouth, he was there wounded, and if he caſt it out of his heart, he was like to take in the knife there alſo; ſo I ſhall humbly reminde thoſe Presbyterians which have varyed and lapſed toward an Independent model, that ſince ſuch applications and condeſcentions have been onely paid with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and have borne no other fruit but obſtinacy in the one part, and danger to the other, that they would adhere unto and cheriſh their proper principles, which need covet no other likeneſs than their own, (becauſe truth is incomparably fairer than the Graecian <hi>Helena,</hi> as <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>) nor pray in any ſupport from carnal prudence, (becauſe honeſty is the beſt policy,) and remembring whence they are fallen would do their firſt works, leſt their Candleſtick be ſhaken, aſwell as their light hath been ſomewhat contracted and obſcured.</p>
               <p>They would perſwade us they comply not with riged Independents, but then it ſeems they are to be ranked among the gentle Independents. The digladiations of Sects are ſometime as eager among themſelves as againſt the truth; the <hi>Maximinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> did virulently conteſt with the <hi>Primianiſts,</hi> yet both were under the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Donatiſts;</hi> they may be all in the ſame way, which yet run faſter and go further one than another. As the Schooles ſay, that every Angel is a ſeveral ſpecies, ſo if ſome difference or ſingularity might conſtitute a ſeveral form, we ſhould have among Independents almoſt as many Religions as men. It is like enough they render no complacency to the rigid Independents, and do yet find no pleaſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception among the right Presbyterians, ſuch a Cataſtrophe is the reſult of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling indifference, and it fares with men of that temperament as with the hypocrite, the world hates him becauſe he ſeemes good, and God abhors him becauſe he is not truly ſuch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They leave the rigid Independents to anſwer that charge of confounding Churches,</hi> and then it ſeemes they depend upon them to be Advocates for them alſo, aſwell as to plead their own cauſe. For however ſelf love may transfer the guilt, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that in others what it will not ſee in it ſelf, (as <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> ſaid nothing was ſo hard as to know, or ſo eaſie as to deceave ones ſelf;) yet this charge hath a <hi>thou art the man</hi> for them alſo, for he is ſomewhat confounded in his judgement that cannot diſcern, or will not confeſſe, that to conſtitute, as they do,

               <p>To ſay, <hi>That they ſeparate nor from true Churches;</hi> Firſt, as it can no more pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate their guilt, than it could cloak that of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> who made the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence (and indeed this is the <hi>Catholicon,</hi> the common place and plea of all Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, that if they forſake one Church they go into another;) ſo ſecondly, they do make a ſeparation from true Churches, ſeeing they ſeparate (as was ſaid) from all Churches that give a free admiſſion to all that are not duly caſt out, and if thoſe are no true Churches, then they are not in the ſtate of ſalvation, for all that ſhall be ſaved are added to the Church, and all that may grow capable of admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion into their Churches out of the other, it may ſeem requiſite to baptize before they are admitted, baptiſme being a note of the true Church, and therefore agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto, as <hi>proprium quarto modo.</hi> They were ſuch Churches wherein many of them received ordination to the Miniſtery (who are not yet reordained) and by the Miniſtery whereof faith was wrought in them (wherein I hope they were built up before they laid the foundation of their new Churches) and to believe is to be added to the Church, which is Synonymous with the houſhold of faith, and wherein if they had ſuffered death for the profeſſion of that faith, they would have thought themſelves intitled unto martyrdome, (and yet out of the Church are no martyrs;) neither can they pretend to reform the Church, if they acknowledge not thoſe from whom they ſeparate to be true Churches, for then they rather form a new Church, and it is not an alteration which is <hi>Motus à qualitate in contrariam qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatem,</hi> but a generation, <hi>motus à non eſſe ad eſſe;</hi> and is not <hi>mutatio ſtatûs ſed eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae.</hi> But this is that root bearing gall and wormwood, which being ſhrunk and dryed up among the <hi>Browniſts,</hi> hath been watered and cheriſht by them to repullu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and ſpread its branches and is grown now to this height, that we are now no true Churches till new gathered.</p>

And thoſe that favoured them all that time, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not favour them ſo much now, if they ſtill are favourable to one and the ſame way, ſave that they have this help for it, that as inferior bodies depend on the motion of the ſuperior; ſo they aime to conform themſelves to the higher revolution, to be more capable of benigner aſpects and influences, and when there is a <hi>tempora mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantur,</hi> there follows alſo, <hi>nos &amp; mutamur.</hi>
               </p>

Yet I preſume firſt, as they would have us believe that they are indulgent to them, that ſo every one elſe might be
<q>Contra libertum Caeſaris ire timens,</q> So ſecondly, I ſuppoſe themſelves conceive their way is plauſible with the higher Powers, or perchance elſe they might take another, and they being ſuppoſed to be ſhadowed by Greatneſs, even that ſhadow (as the <hi>Hyaena's</hi> doth a Doggs) might ſhut up every mans mouth from barking at them, for temporall proſperity is a note of the Church with them, (however they are not Papiſts) which they form ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like that <hi>Venus,</hi> which as <hi>Apelles</hi> told the Painter, that though he had not drawn it fair, yet he had painted her rich. And like him at <hi>Athens</hi> they are ſtill falling in love with the Image of Fortune, and like <hi>Caſſale</hi> the famous Painter at <hi>Sienna,</hi> that drew his own Image in the eye of a great Prince whom he limb'd, they would fain
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:168423:214"/>be ſtill in the eye of Potentates. And thirdly, I ſuppoſe indeed their way needs the ſupport of ſome great powers, being not like to take much or continue very long, unleſſe it be held forth like the <hi>Alcoran</hi> with a ſword in hand.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, <hi>For being injurious to other Miniſters,</hi> I anſw. It is ſome injury to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty aſwell as truth, to outface ſo palpable a wrong, for is not their courſe and way of practice in gathering Churches an equivocal or analogical <hi>plagium,</hi> to rob the ſpiritual Fathers of their Children, &amp;c? Is it not the coveting of the ſtones of their neighbours ſpiritual houſe which he is building for God, or of his wife, (for the Canons ſay there is matrimony betwixt a Paſtor and his Church,) or of that which is his? Is it not the promoving, occaſioning or countenancing many to waive and renounce their own Paſtors, and to forſake the aſſembing of themſelves, to adjoin and unite themſelves to their Conventicles? Can it be other then a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor to thoſe Miniſters both by a tacite diſparagement and deſpiſing of their parts or pains, (and ſo a kind of bearing falſe witneſs) and a leſſening of their people in the multitude whereof is ſome honor, and diſcouraging of them both in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting their harveſt, in the largeneſs whereof is the labourers incitement? and can this be other than an injury? It is that which the old Canons call <hi>Conculcare epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum,</hi> and to trample upon another is to injure him, <hi>Et tamen alter ſi feciſſet idem, caderet ſub judice morum:</hi> They would ſenſe it injurious if done unto themſelves, and they did ſo reſent it, not onely in the taylor (who going beyond his meaſure hath cut out in another faſhion and ſtitcht up a Church more ſtraight laced out of ſome ſhreds of their Congregations;) but in them alſo who have outraced them, and gone beyond the goale which they have ſet up, and ſeparating further from them, have adjoyned themſelves in a Church fellowſhip with them that are full grown Independents. They plead they <hi>conſtraine no man,</hi> but</p>
               <p>Firſt, That is not ſufficient, they ought not to perſwade or invite any to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert their own Paſtors and Churches to engage with theirs, they ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave them if they came voluntary, they are guilty of that evill which they do not hinder and prevent.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Donatiſts</hi> coacted none to aſſociate with them, (they decryed all conſtraint, and complained of the Imperial Edicts made for their coercion;) yet this excuſed not the leaders of that Schiſme.</p>

               <p>They ſay, <hi>they clock no mans chicken,</hi> but to deprave and vilifie other men and their practice, to magnifie their own, and hold it forth as the onely reformation and beſt advantage of godlineſs, and theirs as the alone pure Churches and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and their catching after all that they can thereby decoy, and draw in by theſe like baits, what is it other than a call for the birds to divide them from the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:168423:214"/>flock, and lime twiggs to hold them faſt from flying back, and a virtual (if there were no other expreſſe and explicite perſwaſion) clocking of others mens birds from their proper neſts, to take their flight with them? <hi>Honeſta lucra quibus nemo laeditur,</hi> ſaith <hi>Caſſiodor, &amp; bene acquiritur quòd à nullis adhuc dominis abrogatur,</hi> whereas they trim up their Church like <hi>Aeſops</hi> Crow, with others feathers, for they have mewed almoſt all their own, and are like <hi>Antiochus</hi> ſurnamed <hi>The Hawke,</hi> who patcht up a Kingdom out of what he wreſted from others.

               <argument>
                  <p>Why they have not the Sacrament in their own Churches. Why onely at<hi> Pyworthy. </hi>Whether it be no great matter to be called or drawn thither. Of their return to their own Churches. How they ſtigmatize their people and judge their hearts. Of ſerving the times. They confeſs the Word and Sacrament to be the ſame thing. What thereupon follows.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving thus defended my own works, I might ſpare to make any ſallies, and having born out and repelled their aſſaults, I need not fall out to attempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their lines, and think of ſtorming their Forts; but I might now ſit down at reſt, and enjoy that which <hi>Archidamus</hi> wiſhed the <hi>Elians</hi> when they were upon their march, <hi>bona quies:</hi> For he that is ſilent, ſhall every way hold his peace. But I remember it was a politick and ſucceſsfull counſell that <hi>Achmetes Baſſa</hi> gave to <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Great, that when he could not take <hi>Scodra</hi> by forcible aſſaults, he ſhould block up the Citie with Forts built about it, which would ſo diſtreſs it for want of relief, as it muſt finally ſurrender it ſelfe: ſo perchance though we might defend the ground we have undertaken to make good, notwithſtanding any of their former ſtorms or batteries, yet as long as ſo many appearing Fortreſſes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be built upon Scripture grounds and foundations, ſtand about it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demoliſhed and inexpugned, it may ſeem ſtraightned and diſtreſt, and the wayes of any further acceſſe and more aids will be retrenched. I ſhall therefore examine with what brain they have ſtuffed theſe <hi>Heads,</hi> as they call them, and what they hold <hi>in capite,</hi> and
<q>Qua nitidum tardâ compſerit arte caput,</q> which they ſay (<hi>after they have followed the Author ſtep by ſtep</hi> (though it be rather ſometimes <hi>per ſaltum,</hi> having leapt over many ſteps and not toucht upon them) <hi>they have purpoſed to paſſe over,</hi> though I think it had been better to have ſtood and inſiſted upon them with more weight and circumſpection.</p>
               <p>And however as <hi>Plato</hi> teacheth, <hi>De prolixitate vel brevitate ſcribendi curare nimis ineptum eſt, non enim breviſſima aut longiſſima, ſed optima ſunt eligenda.</hi> Yet being conſcious that my diſcourſe, though it hath been my care with <hi>Sydonius, potius cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam implere quam paginam,</hi> may for the length thereof have already as much excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the readers patience, as my intentions, and remembring what the ſame <hi>Plato</hi> admoniſh'd <hi>Amiſthenes, Orationis modus non eſt penes dicentem ſed audientem,</hi> I ſhal henceforward endeavour to be more conciſe and ſuccinct, and begin <hi>etfi tacere nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, certe taciturire,</hi> and ſay but little, for <hi>breviloquium ſilentio eſt finitimum,</hi> ſaid <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> onely I ſhall aim at ſuch brevity (which <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> ſaith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is laudable) <hi>quae nihil ſubtrahit cognitioni juſtorum.</hi>

               <p>The firſt head which they ſhew forth, is, <hi>Why not the Sacrament in their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations?</hi> From which head, (upon the former account) cutting off that which is ſuperfluous to it, as the hair to the head, though it may ſeem to deck or ſet it out, and which we are deceaved, if they have not already been diſcuſſed all to an hair; it is firſt to be conſidered what they anſwer, <hi>viz. That it is in ſome,</hi> but then that anſwer is onely for ſome, and leaves the moſt without defence. I do not know that before their Book came forth the Sacrament was publikely adminiſtred in any of the proper and peculiar Congregations of thoſe of this aſſociation, ſave in the Cathedral or Mother Church, as I may call it, at <hi>Pyworthie,</hi> unleſs they take all that be of their communion to be alſo of their combination. But if it be in ſome, why not in all? if not in all, why in ſome, if the reaſon why it ought to be in ſome of them, is common to all? and what ſpecial reaſon can they produce why it cannot be in all?</p>
               <p>They ſay, becauſe <hi>at home after their intendment and deſires of ſuch a work ſpoken of in the pulpit, there appeared not a competent number to carry it on, which when there ſhall be found, they are reſolved to return; in the interim they were enforced to adjoin themſelves to a Church which was formed in one of their Congregations, viz. at Pyworthy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the covering is narrower than that he can wrap himſelf in it; the ſtanders by, who commonly do not ſee leſs than they that play the game, cannot diſcerne that there is a greater number of perſons at <hi>Pyworthy</hi> fit and willing to receave the Sacrament, than might have been found at <hi>Holſworthie;</hi> and it will ſeem ſtrange to us that where there hath been a ſucceſſion of topicall Starrs of greater magnitude, that there ſhould be ſtill leſs light, and leſs effects of a quickning and fructifying influence; neither can it but eclipſe the dignity of thoſe Starrs, ſeeing cauſes are beſt judged by their effects. But perchance they were only not ſo fit or willing to come to the Sacrament in their way, and to leave their liberty behind them, ſurrendring up that right which they had to the Sacrament by the character of Baptiſme, and being Church members with a <hi>Dogmatical</hi> faith, to take a new grant thereof by the copy of their countenance, and a tenancy at their wills, and when the Statute <hi>Quia emptores terrarum</hi> forbids the creating of new civill tenures, to ſuffer them to erect new holdings in Spirituals. Their pulpit diſcourſes were directed onely to diſpoſe them for this way of ſubjection, and for their ends, not for the right end, the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, If they at <hi>Pyworthie</hi> were more malleable free ſtones and eaſier to be wrought, yet ſeeing the ſtones whereof this Church was to be built and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, were drawn forth out of ſeveral places, and were brought firſt to be formed and faſhioned at <hi>Holſworthie,</hi> and ſome of them hewed out of that rock, why ſhould they be carried thence to be laid in <hi>Pyworthie?</hi>

There might be ſome reaſons of thrift in the conduct thereof, which is a principle that hath more influence upon thoſe of the Independent principles, than on the more hoſpitable Presbyterians; or of Policy, that their own peculiar Churches might be kept for a reſerve, and to be modelled according to the mode of the time and exigence of emergencies; for whereas they talk of their being a Church formed at <hi>Pyworthie,</hi> in the choice of a Paſtor, &amp;c. as they were the efficients by whom; and the matter of which it was formed, ſo though at their firſt ſitting down there was a Paſtor duly (I think) ordained, yet when he removed his quarters (the phraſe is not improper) he that next aſſumed that charge, was not for divers years after in Orders, and all that while ſure they had no Church formed there according to the rules of Gods Word, in the choice of an appropriate Paſtor, &amp;c. and therefore then not to have reverted to their proper Congregations, and rechurched them, is without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.</p>

If they can ſee a beame in the eyes of others, they ſhould not be ſo blind as not to ſee a rafter in their own; and though they are but little theeves upon the Bench (to invert that proverb) yet they cannot with a juſt confidence condemne the greater at the barre. They maintain the ſame principles of Schiſme from whence all the particular concluſions are deduced, though ſome extract them in a greſſer threed and ſpin it out farther; they think mixt commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions unlawful, and make ſeparations in the Church from thoſe that are not caſt out from it. And whereas in their preface they tell us, [that they are deceived if ever Church reformation and conſtitution prove comfortable and ſucceſsful, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs holding communion with other Churches come to be a matter of more weight] nevertheleſs they deny to hold communion with their own Churches, yea they have renounced their Congregations interpretatively, while they have gathered another, which by appropriation they call their Church, and in part have directly forſaken them, <hi>viz.</hi> in order to the adminiſtration of the Sacrament, though they are not forſaken of God, for I hope they are in a capacity of Salvation by the meanes, and of neceſſity God muſt have a Church, where the purity of doctrine flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, although almoſt overgrown with ſcandals, (as was mentioned out of <hi>Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi>) and though they have not wholly demoliſhed their Churches, they have pulled ſome ſtones from union with the reſt, and transferred them elſewhere, and left the reſt he more inſtable and tottering; and they deſtroy them negatively, <hi>&amp; ut cauſae deficientes,</hi> while they edifie them not by the Sacrament, and though they lay the foundation and build the walls by a communion in the word and prayers, yet they do ſet on the roofe by the Sacrament, which would keep the reſt more firm
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:168423:223"/>together. It muſt needs be a confuſion of Churches, when they ſupport not a diſtinction of parochial cures and charges, and do fabricate one Church with pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces rent out of many; and they ſcatter theſe of their own flock which they do not gather, and thoſe of other mens folds which they do gather. As there are poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial parts of virtues,

He that is departed from one Citie, and is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced but one mile, is gone off as well as he that is removed to the diſtance of ten; and one drop of the Sea is water aſwell as the Ocean, and he that picks my pocket but of ſixpence is a Theefe, aſwell as he that robs me of my whole ſtock, and he that out of malice prepenſed puts out a mans eyes, as well as he that takes away his life, is a felon in the outward Court, and a murderer in the interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Profeſſors be viſible Saints,</hi> (as they ſay here) then the exhibiting of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament unto Profeſſors, (as ſuch are all Church members) is not proſtituting the privileges of the Saints;
<note place="margin">Sect. 5.</note> and there is no great harm done to make them Saints, by affording them the Sacrament (as they would have it elſewhere) who are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Saints by being profeſſors, yet they will heerin ſeem <hi>inſanire cum ratione,</hi> for they ſay,</p>

               <p>And to make them free partakers of their prayers they think they have warrant, <hi>becauſe Paul gave thanks in the preſence of all the paſſengers:</hi> but as the wheate which ſometimes falls from the clouds, is good corn, but was not naturally generated there; ſo though their concluſion be true, yet it doth not naturally flow from their premiſes. <hi>Paul</hi> they ſay gave thanks, that is, prayed in the preſence of them all, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.35. but it is not ſaid that all did pray together with <hi>Paul:</hi> to pray in the preſence of them, and to conjoyn with them in prayer, are different things: they allow others to be preſent at the celebration, yet admit them not to partake of the Sacrament.

                  <hi>The children,</hi> they ſay, <hi>are not baptized in their own right, but in the Churches;</hi> but what intereſt in the Churches rights have thoſe infants which is not rooted in their parents, and their relation to them? And the ſoederall holineſſe which they ſpeak of, is by the virtue of the promiſe made to the ſeed of theſe parents that are in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God. I know they take not the Church <hi>Metonymically,</hi> for the Town or Countrey that contains it, for upon ſuch an account the children of Infidels born within that verge, might have right to baptiſme. Neither doe I underſtand how the right which the Church hath to baptize them is derived, but onely from the Church memberſhip of the parents, or one of them. Now as our Lawes tell us, that the derivative right cannot be greater than the primitive; ſo the Lawes of Philoſophy aſſure us, <hi>Quod facit tale debet eſſe magis tale,</hi> and therefore if the child be receaved unto one Sacrament in the right of the Church, why in the ſame
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:168423:226"/>ſhould not the parents be admitted to the other, the right for the one and other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing founded in the Church-memberſhip of the parents?</p>

None pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes a withdrawing from, a noting, a not eating with, ſhutting up, or giving out, not caſting pearls, giving holy things to men ignorant, but ſcandalous, and all that can be with the ſtrongeſt heat diſtilled from thoſe Texts, is onely the caſting out of notorious ſinners, not the taking in of any untill upon probation they have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated their true holineſſe. Moſt of the texts forbid a familiar and ſociall unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary converſation with wicked men, not a communion in the Sacrament. Thoſe which may ſeem to prohibite their partaking of holy things, doe deny them generally, and abſolutely, there is no limitation or reſtraint of the prohibition to the Lords Supper, and as there is no reſtriction in relation to the matter, ſo neither any determination or fixing of the time and ſpeciall occaſion, as that it muſt be done onely in the reforming of a long corrupted Church. Many of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are negative, and whatſoever their obligation be, <hi>obligant ſemper &amp; ad ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> not only in times of reforming, and the affirmative commands are indefinite and abſolute, binding alwayes upon all occaſions, they are ſure, and ſtand faſt for ever and ever. So the Apologiſts have herein dealt like the <hi>French,</hi> who when they have prickt a tune, do not ſing after it, and like the Oſtrich, when they have laid their egges, they leave them in the earth, and onely warm them with duſt.</p>
               <p>But as we have viewed the generall affections of their arguments, ſo let us take a ſurvey of what agrees to them in ſpeciall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of thoſe Texts which contribute more or leſſe to warrant their practice,</hi> (it ſeems they are conſcious that ſome pay in but a little contribution, and we are confident that none do much) the firſt in their (no doubt but) decent order, is 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. <hi>Let all things be done decently &amp; in order.</hi> But if this be the capitall proof (as <hi>Iuſtine</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> ſlain at the battell of <hi>Mantinaea,</hi> The head of the ſpear being taken off, the trunk would do little hurt; ſo if this head of their argumentation be ſo blunt, and the edge thereof ſo eaſily rebated, we may more boldly venture upon the reſidue: for ſure this proof might not onely have been removed from the tribe, and been debarred its ſufferage, but it is not capable to be among the very <hi>Aerarii,</hi> it can pay no contribution, it is ſo poor, onely they will ſet it among the <hi>proletarii</hi> to beget one argument the more in number.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I might rationally enough, if I would raiſe arguments <hi>ad hominem</hi> (only <hi>arte perire ſua</hi>) retort their own words, <hi>that the Apoſtles ſcope is far from the buſineſſe in hand,</hi> for as is the judgment of <hi>Aquinas, Eſtius, Piſcator, Menochius; &amp;c. all things</hi> here mentioned are onely the things ſpoken of before, <hi>Decency</hi> referring to the habit and ſilence of women, <hi>Order</hi> relating to the uſe of ſpirituall gifts, and their ſpeaking not together, but one after another, firſt one then another for exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:168423:230"/>of them, but I ſhall acknowledge that generall Rules are applicable to all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of the ſame kind and nature, and whatſoever can be derived from any thing was contained in it.</p>
               <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">In locum.</note> itis well obſerved by <hi>Muſculus, Non eſt univerſalis vocula trahenda ad omnia quae temere ſunt in Eccleſia introducta — ſed quae legitimè &amp; neceſſoriè gerenda ſunt in Eccleſia, decenter &amp; ordine competenti gerantur;</hi> So as firſt they ſhould have proved the matter to be lawfull and neceſſary, and then ſuit the manner of doing it to order and decency.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, from this propoſition, <hi>All things ſhould be done decently and in order,</hi> they can never extract any concluſion for them, but by an <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> (which will be whipt away for begging the queſtion) that their doings are decent and orderly; the firſt is as chearfully as neceſſarily conceded, the later no leſſe ſtrongly denied by us than aſſerted by them: this is our controverſie, and the iſſue we have joyn'd upon them, and the determination of the queſtion depends upon what hath been produced on either ſide, and to give in a verdict, there had need bee a view of al the pleadings, and an examination of all the evidence produced.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Text alleaged is but a remote and mediate principle for proof of their practice, the order and decency thereof is to be the proximate and immediate ground of its approbation; for the Scripture onely ſaith in generall, things ought to be done decently and in order, but that ſuch a particular way is orderly and decent, depends upon the conſiderations of rectified reaſon, and godly pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and things have their chief dependance upon their neareſt cauſes and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and upon this reflection it is that they deny that thoſe humane lawes doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly bind the conſcience, which obliege not in reſpect of the matter thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they bind not <hi>primò &amp; per ſe, ſed ſecundariò at<expan>

               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, this is an itinerant <hi>Topick,</hi> and a common argument, and may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt to ſerve me againſt them, and will muſter among my Forces, who am as certain to have made it evident, that their way is not decent nor orderly, as they are confident to have proved it to be ſo.

               <p>Sixthly, if they had evidenced their way to be decent and orderly, yet that could onely riſe to juſtifie it ſelfe, not reach to condemn another, it might warrant the ſetting up thereof, not condemn the pulling down of all beſide, another way might be as orderly and decent as that, for theſe have ſome latitude, and conſiſt not in a point, though <hi>unum &amp; verum convertuntur,</hi> yet <hi>one</hi> and <hi>orderly</hi> or <hi>decent</hi> are not ſo convertible,

               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:168423:230"/>
               <p>Seventhly, when this text was produced by the Epiſcopall party, to warrant ſome ceremonies, I know who denyed the argument,
<note place="margin">T.C.</note> and asked why we ſhould hang our judgment upon the Churches ſleeve, and why in matters of Order more than in matters of Doctrine? But however this be a rule by which things belonging to the policy of the Church, are to be regulated in Diſcipline and Rites, and things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, not ſpecially determined by Scripture, yet the matters that fall under ſuch regulation bind not the conſcience of themſelves, and with ſuch conſtitutions God is not worſhipped, ſaith <hi>Paraeus,</hi>

               <p>They conceive, and ſay it is confeſſed, <hi>That it were a glorious and comfortable thing if none but holy perſons did draw neer to this holy table, and they aſſume, A general Rule will bear up a glorious and comfortable practice in the Church.</hi> And if that be the <hi>Propoſition</hi> and this the <hi>Aſſumption,</hi> what I beſeech you is like to be, or what is likely they intend ſhould be the concluſion, which among ſo many terms we can upon no terms make out? This may be ſome of <hi>Chryſippus</hi> his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, which the Gods would have uſed, but men were too dull to underſtand the uſe thereof. If they intend that a glorious and comfortable practice will be born up by this command, to do all things decently and in order, I ſuppoſe it would be better ſupported by its proper ſtrength, formally as it is a glorious and comfortable practice, more than as decent and orderly, but then what is this practice? <hi>viz.</hi> that onely holy perſons draw near the holy table. Be it ſo, let that be a glorious and comfortable practice, as they can take no glory, ſo neither can we any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, if they ſhould thence infer, therefore they may debarre from coming all thoſe of whoſe holineſſe they are not convinced. We have elſewhere ſhewed, they are ſeverall queſtions, and of ſundry latitudes, who ſhould come, and who ought to be admitted; none may be excluded but for crimes notorious, but it is enough that they are not ſcandalous to make them capable to be received. And I hope we have ſufficiently demonſtrated, that al that having a <hi>Dogmatical</hi> faith are members of the Church, which is Chriſts family, have a right to eat at his Table, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe will ſhew, that thoſe that are not cut off from Eccleſiaſticall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, cannot be kept off from the main part thereof, communion in Sacraments.
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:168423:231"/>If then none but holy perſons ſhall draw to the holy table, all Church members muſt be holy, really I mean, for relatively they are ſo, but all the whole viſible Church collectively ſhall be ſincerely holy, when any the parts thereof diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively are perfectly holy, and that ſhall be onely when we come to eat and drink at his table in his Kingdome. An holy and blameleſs Church without ſpot or wrinkle is indeed glorious, but it is <hi>gloriae patriae, non viae,</hi> a glory reſerved for the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, not beſtowed during the warfare, and it is now ſo glorious onely in the hope it ſhall be; here her falrneſs is but comparative among Women, in reſpect of the reſt of the world, <hi>inter animas terrenas, non autem inter evangelicas beatitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bernard.</hi> The ſubject matter therefore of glory and comfort beares reſemblance with that of vowes, things poſſible, lawful, and acceptable to God; but to put all from communion in Sacraments ſave the truly holy is neither poſſible, <hi>Boni nunquam ſoli ſunt niſi in caelo</hi> (ſaith <hi>Gregory,</hi>) there will be tares ſtill among the Wheat, even <hi>

It were a glorious and comfortable thing that Philoſophers were Kings, and Kings Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, yet it ſhould be piacular to pull down Kings and ſet up Philoſophers. It were glorious and comfortable that every man which had a title to an eſtate in the exterlour Court, had alſo a right in the interiour, and that dominion were found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in grace; yet it is not lawful to diſſeiſe or out any man of his freehold, that holds not over by fealty of the high Lord of all. It were a glorious and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thing if there were an harmony of ſpirits between a man and his wife,
<q>Nec malè inaequales veniant ad aratra juvenci,</q> but if a man be unequally yoaked and ſhrewdly matched, yet I think the <hi>Apologiſts</hi> (whatſoever their lot be) do not ſuppoſe it lawful to turn the wife to graſſe, and plow with a tamer heifer. It were I ſhould think, a glorious and comfortable thing, if every one that aſſumes to be a wiſe man in print, could juſtly pretend to much art, and that every one that ſerves in the Tabernacle had not onely bells of pure gold, but alſo jewels of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> wherewith to adorne and furniſh it; but though the <hi>Apologiſts</hi> ſay <hi>they pretend not to much art,</hi> yet they would have ſenſed it an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to have been ſuſpended from the Preſſe, and much more (and I confeſſe more juſtly) reſent the wrong to be repelled from their office and Benefice.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it were a glorious and comfortable thing, if all that were planted and watered in the Church by baptiſme, were onely the branches in Chriſt bearing fruit, and themſelves purged to bring forth more fruit; that all that hear did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceave the word with faith, and all that did pray did pray in faith, and lifted up their hearts with their hands to God in the Heavens, but yet the <hi>Apologiſts</hi> are not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to ſuch a latitude of ſeparation as to admit none to theſe Ordinances, but ſuch onely whom they have tryed to be thus conditioned and qualified.</p>
               <p>It is ſuch another argument that is uſed by <hi>Tapper</hi> for merit, It is, ſaith he, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for the Saints to demand heaven as victors and triumphers, as a palme due to their ſweats. That diminutive of nothing, Man, will ſtill rob God of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not onely by want of people, in the multitude whereof is the Kings honour,

And therefore that the <hi>Phantaſmes</hi> or judgements of any particular men ſhould become the Law of Order and Decency (as <hi>Hicrom</hi> ſaith of <hi>Origen, Ingenii ſui acumina putat Eccleſiae eſſe Sacramenta)</hi> is neither orderly nor decent, and for every man to do that which is right in his own eyes, is rather the conſequent of no Law in Iſrael; and <hi>anomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am habet omnis autonomia,</hi> ſaith <hi>Herodotus.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. When the action was thus warranted, the time of undergoing their pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, the manner thereof, and the ſteps and degrees of their reſtitution, was but the formality and circumſtances of the Action, which lying without the comprehenſion of Order and Decency, fell under the determination of the Church, whoſe power regularly moves in three Sphears only, 1. To publiſh the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of Chriſt. 2. By their Cenſures to puniſh Offenders againſt the ſame. 3. In preſcribing things that pertain to comlineſs and order.

                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:168423:233"/>but taking order and decency in this notion, the Church hath no power to make Lawes in things of ſuch concernment; but <hi>Order</hi> in this place of the Apoſtle comprehendeth the circumſtances of ſeaſon, time, and place; and <hi>comlineſs</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that gravity and modeſty in the performance of the works of Gods ſervice, which beſeems actions of that nature,

               <p n="3">3. The ancient church held not forth that manner and degrees of pennance as a Divine Inſtitution, nor neceſſarily implicating the conſcience, but as an act of Diſcipline of a <hi>medious</hi> and indifferent nature (when abſtracted from their poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Conſtitution) and therefore it was tranſitory in reſpect of time, and ambula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory in regard of place, not alwayes nor every where obſerved. But as their Diſcipline hath no Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution like a great ſum to obtain its free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the Church, ſo they pretend it was free born, and is of divine not humane Eſtabliſhment; and therefore they prevaricate and betray their Cauſe when they compare it to that Model of Diſcipline for the Paeniten's, and do interpretative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and virtually acknowledge it hath only a like foundation with that, which alſo they confeſs had no particular warrant from the Scripture, ſave this general rule of doing things in order and decency, which was no ſpecial or immediate command for the ſame, but only a Praecept, That the Church ſhould do what ſeemed orderly and decent, and in this very particular what ſeemed ſo in one age and place, did not in another.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is yet a greater difference between their Diſcipline and that of the old Paenitents, this being only in a thing not ſpecially determined by Scripture, and theirs is againſt what the Scripture hath determined, as we conceave we have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently evidenced.</p>

We never have denied them all authority to ſeparate men from the Church by excommunication, as well as from the world by preaching the word, the queſtion is not of the act of Separation, but of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and the objects, who are thoſe <hi>vile,</hi> and how the ſeparation muſt be made, but to inferre, <hi>a ſeparation is warranted by Gods word, therefore their way of Separating is warrantable,</hi> is an argument <hi>A genere ad ſpecicm affirmativè.</hi> Did they put none into the account of <hi>vile,</hi> but ſuch onely as had given ſcandall by notorious crimes, and not thoſe alſo which had not by ſubmiſſion to their diſcipline, merited their appobation, and become pretious alone at the price of their freedome, and to ceaſe to be <hi>vile,</hi> muſt contract a kind of <hi>villenage</hi> ſervilly to hold at the will of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; did they ſeparate in a judiciall way ſuch particular perſons from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, and not whole Congregations by an arbitrary ſentence, or rather not ſeparate themſelves from the congregation, we ſhould not interrupt, nor check with them in their way, though it be not drawn out by any line in this Text, and we ſhould grant it were right Diſcipline, though not rooted naturally in this Scripture, as it might be right <hi>Ivy</hi> that as <hi>Nicrem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berge</hi> tells us, grew out of a Stagges horn, and a right blade of Corn that ſprung from a Womans Noſe, yet neither was naturalll to that place.</p>
               <p>What they write therefore of Excommunication, is but as the ſhedding of inke by the <hi>Sepia</hi> to eſcape diſcovery. It argues the deformity of their way that they dare not ſhew it in its own face, but with ſuch paint, and under this dilguiſe; for Excommunication is that which we neither oppoſe nor they contend for, and for their part there is an obſervable teſtimony thereof in that they produce very few of thoſe Scripture proofs which are uſually alleaged for, and do pregnantly aſſert it; but becauſe thoſe are not ſo aptly conducing to their ſcope and purpoſe, they bring forth others little or nothing pertinent to that matter, and from whence it cannot be otherwiſe deduced then as the <hi>Metaphyſicks</hi> ſay, that by long circuit any truth may be derived from another, and perchance they withhold thoſe ſtronger Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments leaſt they might diſparage theirs by compariſon, as the Painter that had

               <p>They enumerate ſundry kinds or wayes of Separation, but it had been as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to their undertaking, as ſutable to the expectation of reaſon, to have demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated how all of theſe were founded in this text, or ſupported thereby; for when they ſimply and nakedly affirm them to be ſo, <hi>in magna ſermenis latitudine uno bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſſimo verbo quod dicitur, proba, in arctiſſimas coarctaris anguſtias,</hi> as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to <hi>Petilian.</hi>

And for the ſecond, A man that will ſtand in an higher place, and ſignifie more in their account than <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> viz. <hi>Aretius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting thoſe texts, affirms, That <hi>private familarity corrupteth the manners of thoſe that converſe together, but the common uſe of the Sacraments doth not ſo. — I muſt eſchew his familiarity, whom I ought not to avoid at the Sacrament, for at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he will not corrupt me, that may do ſo at a private ſupper.</hi> And this opinion is fortified with pregnant Reaſons which we have elſewhere produced,
<note place="margin">In the diatribe</note> and which may be farther backt and ſeconded; for at the Sacrament evil men take truce with all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of evil influence, from whence others may contract or ſuck in contagion; and <hi>Saul</hi> himſelf did prophecy whiles he was among the Prophets, and there we converſe (externally at leaſt) and have to do with God, not men, and we may chuſe and muſt diſcreetly make choice of our familiar companions, but it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in our power nor of our duty to make ſuch diſcrimination of our company at the Sacrament, for we finde only a command that every man ſhould examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in order to communicating, but if we were patible of any inſection to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, or pollution to be incurred at the Sacrament, we ſhould have been put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a command of examining every man one another; but themſelves do not think it an incumbency upon every man to try another, but only that they or the Elders ſhould make this tryal of all: but as when <hi>Braſidas</hi> was ſlain, his Mother ſaid, That though he were a good man, yet <hi>Sparta</hi> had many better; ſo if theſe texts were taken off from the ſupport of Church cenſures, yet other Scriptures would better bear up and confirm them; and alſo though <hi>Hierom, Auguſtine, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalio &amp;c.</hi> read, <hi>ſignifie that man by an Epiſtle</hi> (which is the marginal reading of our Bibles) yet, ſince that indication to be made to the Apoſtle, was only that he might thereupon inflict the cenſure, and ſo would finally and in effect be the ſame thing with <hi>note him</hi> in their ſenſe, therefore let it be yielded that theſe texts are properly to be underſtood of theſe cenſures.</p>
               <p>And we grant (what they alleage) that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſo interprets them, though they miſtake the place, as if they had not had inſpection into the text, but as he there approves only <hi>coertiones licitae</hi> and allowed (which we deny theirs to be) ſo he alſo permits ſuch cenſures <hi>ſalva unitatis pace in eccleſia,</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1 Cor. 5.11. </hi>Ventilated, and the chaff of their interpretation diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Whether we may have communion in ſacred things with ſuch as we may not have ſociety with in civill.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WE need here onely glean and gather ſome few ears, having formerly cut down the harveſt, not onely becauſe elſewhere we have ventilated the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument drawn from this Text, but becauſe alſo the anſwer ſhaped to the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the former Section, will ſult in great part for a reply to this, as if it had been cut out for it. If we ſhould concede, that the eating, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. were of that kind, which I confeſſe it taſts and reliſheth to be in many learned palats, yet it will not give fat and ſtrength to their cauſe, but will prove to them like <hi>Zeuxes</hi> his painted grapes, which will do thoſe high flying birds no good.</p>
               <p>Many judicious men indeed underſtand this of caſting out of communion, and avoiding the excommunicate, but the Apologiſts unjuſtly add a Byas to them, to bring them to their mark, when they reſtrain and limit it to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from the Sacraments, which the very Authors they cite (as the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turiſts, Aqulnas, &amp;c.</hi>) do affirm of an expulſion from Eccleſiaſticall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in generall, and ſome of them in terms expreſsly ſpeak of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</p>
               <p>But is the power of excommunication the ſubject matter of our controverſie? or are thoſe whom they debarre the Sacrament actually excommunicate, or ſo much as formally ſuſpended? Can they
<q>— vitiis nigrum praefigere Theta?</q> convince them to merit to be inſcribed into the black Roll of either of them? the Sword or the Dagger (as <hi>Caligula</hi> called his miſchievous Books?) are they all fornicators, covetous, extortioners, idolaters? will themſelves call them ſo?

                  </q> And not rather,
<q>— niveis abſolvere dignos?</q> The onely crime that the moſt of them can be charged with, is ſomewhat like that of the <hi>Indians,</hi> who when as <hi>De las Caſas</hi> tells us, the Spaniards made proclamation, that they ſhould come quickly &amp; do their homage, they came not under ſubjection, &amp; therefore onely were they fallen upon. Why do they then lurk under the ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuge of excommunication, as if that were the thing controverted, which yet is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther practiſed by them, nor gainſaid by us? <hi>Quid obſecro quia incidiſti in defenſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem temerariae falſitatis, nebulas manifeſtis rebus coneris offundere?</hi> as <hi>Auguſtin</hi> to <hi>Creſconius;</hi> and from the lawfulneſſe of that diſcipline to ſeek to legitimate theirs, is as if becauſe the Lord hath created medicines of the earth, and he that is wiſe will not abhor them, therefore immethodical and ignorant <hi>Empyricks, Cauſifici &amp; ſanicidae</hi> may warrant their practice, <hi>qui per mortes agunt experimenta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There be alſo notwithſtanding many learned palats that cannot reliſh ſuch kind of eating here, nor digeſt this ſenſe, <hi>Calvin, Bullinger, Piſcator, Muſculus, Paraus, Aretius, Hammond, Grotius, a Lapide, Menochius, Tirinus, &amp;c.</hi> who rather ſuppoſe,

                  </note> is ſignified the not having fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar converſation, or an intimate friendly ſociety. <hi>Tertullian</hi> when he writ againſt the Church, underſtands it in the ſenſe of the Apologiſts, <hi>non cibum, nedum Euchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiam,</hi> but when his writing was in the behalfe of the Church, be interprets it <hi>Arcendos eſſe ab omni communicatione fraternitatis,</hi> and clearly that it cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of eating at the Lords Table, there are irrefragable reaſons.</p>
               <p>For firſt, This <hi>not eating</hi> is evidently conſignificant with <hi>companying,</hi> v. 9. and the beginning of this verſe, is onely a redoubling of the prohibition with a kind of amplifying, <hi>Epanorthoſis; not to company, no not ſo much as to eat,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Muſcul. com. in locum.</note> though it might ſeem no great or long ſociety. <hi>Non ſimpliciter dicit,</hi> ſaith <hi>Muſculus, cum ejuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modicibum non eſſe ſumendum, ſed nè cibum quidem, innuens omnem vitae conſuetudinem illis denegandam eſſe, ita ut &amp; id quod minus videtur habere periculi illis imputetur,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Becauſe there is nothing in the context that may incline and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to ſuch an interpretation, nor any ſuch Scripture <hi>Ideom</hi> or parallel place where <hi>eating</hi> ſimply doth ſignifie partaking of the Lords Supper, nor is there any mention of the Sacrament, nor any thing relating thereunto in that Chapter, for that <hi>to keep the feaſt, not with the old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedneſſe,</hi> ſhould be meant (as ſome would have it) of celebrating the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt,</hi> without mixture of ſcandalous perſons, our faith hath neither ſuch an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrich dull appetite to ſwallow, or ſtrong ſtomack to digeſt. The Sacrament is there no more reflected upon, or intimated, than any other act of a Chriſtian liſe, which onely can be therein comprehended as particuiars are in generals, but is not eſpecially or directly, much leſſe primarily or chiefly reſpected. The Apoſtle had much ſhrunk and let fall very low the influence and efficacie of that reaſon or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <hi>Chriſt our Paſſover is ſacrificed,</hi> if he had onely inferred, therefore partake the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> without the ſociety of perſons ſcandalous. And though <hi>the purging out of the old leaven,</hi> may conſequently include the caſting out of the inceſtuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (as ſome Interpreters conſent) yet that is not it which was principally or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly intended; for the purging out of ſuch offenders could not make them a new lump; but rather the cleanſing themſelves from the old man, and the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, <hi>Quicquid in iis ſuperbiae de veteri homine remanſiſſet,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and to the ſame effect <hi>Hierom,</hi> or, <hi>vitioſos naturae veteris ſen corruptae affectus,</hi> as <hi>Piſcator,</hi> and whereof their fornication, being puſt up, glorying and not mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and relaxation of diſcipline was a part. That inceſtuous perſon, however he might be as leaven, yet why the old leaven? And as it would be a very harſh interpretation if by <hi>neither with malice and wickedneſſe,</hi> ſhould be meant, not with ſociety of wicked and malicious men, and conſequently to ſuit the <hi>Antitheſis, the ſweet bread of ſincerity and truth,</hi> ſhould ſignifie holy or worthy communicants; ſo alſo the feaſt may not be kept as it ought, though the one were caſt out, and the other only admitted, for this alone comprehends not all that is here commanded, other ſins might leaven them, though this were reformed; and ſince the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>As ye are unleavened,</hi> the purging out of the old leaven cannot be the caſting out of the inceſtuous perſon, for they had not begun to do that, they were in that reſpect not in part unleavened, but they were blamed for altogether neglecting thereof: but it ſuits well, and followes fitly according to our ſenſe, purge out the vitlous affections of your corrupt old nature, as you have begun to mortifie that
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:168423:241"/>old man, as <hi>Piſcator</hi> expounds it. Beſide, the leaven had but a little influence if it had leavened them onely by a mixt communion at the Lords Table, and if the ſcandalous muſt be purged leſt they corrupt others, it muſt be don univerſally where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever that corruption may be diffuſive, which is in other kinds of communion and fellowſhip more than at the Sacrament. More rationally therefore <hi>Martyr</hi> (and <hi>Bullinger</hi> alſo) teach us, <hi>A ſingulari cauſa perſuadendae excommunicationis orationem transfert ad generalem, quâ omnes hortatur ad innecentiam vitae, &amp; abnegationem vitae prioris,</hi> and ſaith <hi>Piſcator, Ex hypotheſi deducit ad theſin, exſpeciali exemplo admonitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem generalem, ut fugiant peccata &amp; ſtudeant pietati:</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe <hi>Calvin,</hi> Becauſe <hi>Chriſt our Paſſover is ſacrificed, let us keep the feaſt,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, that is, be holy. <hi>Quantum ſupereſt temporis hujus vitae,</hi> ſaith <hi>Martyr,</hi> not onely at certain times or occaſions, <hi>omne tempus, epulationis eſſet tempus Chriſtianis propter collatorum beneficiorum excellentiam,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtom:</hi> and <hi>Muſculus</hi> tells us, <hi>Habet autem myſtica iſta feſti celebratio primùm ferias ab operibus mortuis, deinde publicum gaudium,</hi> as the <hi>Jewes</hi> abſtain from leaven ſeven dayes, ſo we muſt from ſins, all our life; <hi>Eſt enim numerus ſeptenarius perfectionis ſymbolum, donec advenerit dies octavus, qui futurae quietis eſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Muſculus,</hi> to whom <hi>Hierom</hi> gave that hint, which alſo <hi>Alapide, Gagnaeus, Sa, Tirinus</hi> follow, and this way indeed runs the current of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, and <hi>Paraeus</hi> in terms delivers himſelf, <hi>Neque enim de ſacra coena hic a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitur, ſed de cultu morali ſeu vita Chriſtiana;</hi> onely ſome Papiſts, to whom our Antagoniſts, it ſeems, will lay a foundation to build upon, will needs underſtand this feaſt of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> that ſome of them may thereby prove a proper ſacrifice of Chriſt in the Maſſe, and others the celebration with unleavened bread, &amp; certainly the expoſitions given by thoſe that fight againſt us in this ſubject, muſt needs ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize, and confirm the Papiſts in their opinion of the Scriptures obſcurity, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſenſes which they render, are involved under ſuch dark expreſſions, and ſo much beyond common apprehenſions, and drawn forth with ſo much hardneſſe and difficulty; and doubtleſs they that can digeſt this interpretation of a Feaſt here, are ſo hungry after Arguments, that like the Prodigall they can think husks a Feaſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This is ſuch an eating as the Apoſtle did not altogether forbid them to participate in with the fornicators of the world, but he could not but have prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to partake of the Sacrament with thoſe heathens of the world, though they had not been fornicators, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is ſuch an eating as if we ſhould not have ſociety in with the men of the world that are without, we muſt go out of the world; but we nee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> not go out of the world though we ſhould have no fellowſhip with them in eating of the Lords Supper, for no Chriſtian in the world hath ſuch a ſociety in eating, ſince men of the world do not communicate therein.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If <hi>to company</hi> and <hi>to eat</hi> are here <hi>Identicall,</hi> then by an Argument <hi>ad hominem,</hi> it cannot be eating at the holy Table, for they admit of their company there, (they may be preſent and look on) but will not permit them to eat.</p>
               <p>But they think it followes <hi>à minore ad majus, If we may not eat common bread then much leſs ſacred with them,</hi> and they produce the judgment of <hi>Par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Every man till he be juſtly cut off from the commuion,

               <p>Secondly, is not this as odious a diſhonour to the Churches of God, as a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement to particular perſons, that they ſhould be made as kennels or hogſties by having about ninety nine doggs or ſwine to one holy Chriſtian? <hi>How great a blaſphemie is this</hi> ſaith the great <hi>Chamier</hi> to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi>

We confeſs notwithſtanding among Chriſtians, not a few there are which lead a life too much depraved, but we deny any of them that are to be reckoned of the Church, to be in the number of thoſe that are here ſignified by doggs and ſwine, although they live wickedly.</hi> So he.

The very inſpection into the text may check their aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for in that of <hi>Proverbs</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>that as a dogg returneth to his vomit, ſo a fool returneth to his folly,</hi> but may a man be denominated from every thing whereunto he may in any reſpect be aſſimilated? or can a likeneſs <hi>ſecundum quid</hi> warrant an appellation <hi>ſimpliciter?</hi> If ſo, then as the <hi>Chymiſts</hi> fancy, that there is nothing in the great world, which is not repreſented in the little, and there is really nothing within the claſp of the univerſe, but man doth in ſome regard reſemble it, then as <hi>Adam,</hi> once gave names to the creatures, ſo now they might denominate man, and man is all things, and you may call him what you will.</p>
               <p>That of <hi>Peter</hi> is but a rehearſal of that Proverb, with an enlargement concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſow, and if I ſhould concede that here wicked men were called Doggs and Swine, yet let them recognize what thoſe wicked men were, <hi>viz.

               <p n="5">5.

               <p>
                  <hi>But becauſe men muſt examine themſelves, therefore they muſt be examined, ſince for lack of knowledge and grace, unconverted men neither can nor will examine themſelves, and that ſuch ignorant and impenitent perſons may be excluded, therefore they ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine them, for upon this ground, infants, fools, and madmen are not admitted, becauſe unable to examine themſelves;</hi> 'Tis well thoſe whom they exclude have gotten one ſtair higher to be ranked with infants, fools, and madmen, for that is a degree above dogs and ſwine.

But if unconverted men cannot examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they are ſet under a perplexity that they can neither approach nor refrain the Lords Table, nor come there, nor yet ſtay away; for they may not refrain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:168423:248"/>they find themſelves unworthy, and they cannot ſo conclude of themſelves if they cannot examine themſelves; neither can they be warned to ſtay away upon want of Faith and Repentance, if they be under an incapacity of diſcerning this want.

They are open ſcandals only which they ought to proceed upon, but whereas they ſay, <hi>unconverted men have not knowledge to examine themſelves,</hi> we ſhall concede they have not, ſo as to approve themſelves to God, but they may have ſo much as to acquire an applauſe from men, and many truly regenerate Chriſtians alſo may ſenſe that in the heart, which they cannot yet make out plauſibly through the mouth, as they ſay one kind of Cedars bears fruit but no flowers, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother brings forth bloſſoms but no fruit, and ſome may be like the <hi>Sentida</hi> which ſeems withered if you touch or come neer it, and others like that Plant at <hi>Sombre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> which above ground is verdant, and the root but a Serpent; and this may tend to ſet up the beſt talkers for the beſt Chriſtians, and put thoſe out of countenance that are leſs bold and talkative.</p>

               <p>Secondly, No man hath ſuch a claim to Orders, but that it is not ſufficient that the Ordainer knows not the contrary, but he muſt poſitively know his worthineſs, but a Church member hath ſuch a right to the ſeales of that faith which he profeſſeth, and to the notes of that Church wherein he is incorporated, as to receive them unleſs he be publickly known to be unworthy, the one requires ſpecial <hi>Chariſmataes,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther onely common graces to entitle to the ſigns (though ſpecial be requiſite to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the things ſignified.)</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Often the perſons to be ordained are not known unto or familiarly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Ordainer, but the Paſtor ſhould be more converſant with his flock then to be ignorant of their condition.</p>

                  </note> No grace is now uſually given by Ordination to meliorate the perſons, but grace is conferred by the Sacrament adjumental to their amendment.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Notwithſtanding all this, thoſe that are notoriouſly worthy the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſts ſay are not to be examined before Ordination, and the gloſſe on <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> tells us, <hi>Teſtimonium populi aequivalet examinationi, verum ſufficit quod clericus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinandus habeat famam perſe, &amp; per hoc etiam patet, quod noti non ſunt examinandi, ſed

               <p>Beſide, the prohibition here to <hi>partake of other mens ſins,</hi> in the judgment of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> and others, is onely this, Although others break forth into this raſhneſſe (to ordain perſons unworthy) do not thou follow, or have fellowſhip with them in ſuch acts, not thoſe of the ordained but ordainers.

               <p>Thirdly, this text doth give no immediate or proper confirmation to their way in it ſelf, but onely proves it <hi>in alio,</hi> and by a remote principle, but the effect is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the immediate cauſe which contributes or diſpoſeth to that form which denominates, as we ſay, <hi>Sol &amp; homo generant hominem,</hi> yet the man is onely ſaid to be the father, though he be quickned to generation by the Suns influence; ſo though Governors are animated with power by God to make Lawes that muſt be obeyed, yet thoſe Lawes cannot properly be ſaid to be commanded by God, but by men, onely ſecundarily and by accident from God: and I may as well ſay, that every ſtatute-law is to be proved by the word of God, becauſe it enjoyns obedience to Magiſtrates, as they can confirm their diſcipline by this text, becauſe it commands ſubmiſſion to Paſtors.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If by force of this Scripture they are to be obeyed ſimply, abſolutely, and without any condition (as the Papiſts ſay of the Pope) then truly we may ſay farther of them as the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> do of him, That God and he have but one Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and we may not appeal from him unto God, and with Dr. <hi>Stapleton</hi> that we ought onely to look not what is ſpoken but who ſpeakes, and we muſt be enthral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to that ſervile faith preſcribed by he old <hi>Rabbins</hi> who becauſe the Law com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <hi>not to decline from the word which they ſhall ſhew thee to the right hand or to the left,</hi> infer, that when they ſay of the right hand, it is the leſt, &amp; of the left that it is the right, we muſt believe them, or be modelled to that blind obedience of the <hi>Ieſuits, ſicut jumentum obedit Domino, &amp; ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>But certainly it is evident that the Temple did not Type the Table of the Lord, no man ever fell upon that fancy,
<q>Tam vana nullum decepit imagine ſomnus:</q> And therefore however this Argument might ſeem ſubſervient to prove the caſting out of the Church by Excemmunication, or might reflect a little ſuperficial gloſſe on the Independent way of admitting none into the Church but manifeſt Saints, yet it bears no colour to paint over their practice, who permit them to be Members of the Church and partakers of other Ordinances, whom they exclude from the Lords Supper: And if hereby the Church had been figured, and alſo that no wicked perſon ſhould enter therein, yet either the Church was thereby deſcribed, as women were by <hi>Sophocles,</hi> only what they ought to be, not what they were; or as they ſhall be in Heaven, that new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where no unclean perſon ſhall enter; for otherwiſe it can be no true Church whereof any wicked perſons are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe legal uncleanneſſe is clean wide from figuring or obumbrating either ſcandalous ſins, which may merit caſting out; or irregeneration, for which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendedly they let not in. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. There might be legal uncleanneſſe without any ſin, as in ſome diſeaſes of men and women, and in ſome neceſſary or caſual contacts; and there might be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious ſins without any legal uncleaneſſe: ſins did not make legally upclean, nor
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:168423:255"/>legal uncleanneſſe alwayes ſinful, unleſſe a man did wilfully neglect his clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. A holy man might be unclean, and a wicked man clean.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All ſin was forbidden by God, and no ſin was neceſſary, but all unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe was not prohibited, and ſome was of neceſſity to be contracted, as that which grew from Burial of the dead, <hi>Numb.</hi> 19.11. or removing dead Carcaſſes, <hi>Levit.</hi> 11.39. and making of the water of ſeparation, <hi>Numb.</hi> 19. verſ. 7.</p>

               <p>But notwithſtanding this it is hath been even the bane of peace and truth, and the matter of moſt earthquakes that have ſhaken the Church of God, that indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things have been with ſuch animoſity preſſed as neceſſary, as well as that things deletorious have been held forth for <hi>Alexipharmacous,</hi> and too many like <hi>Auguſtus</hi> take on them to tax the world to pay tribute to their opinions and inſtitutions, and (according to what <hi>Mindanes</hi> the mother of <hi>Cyrus</hi> dreamd) what is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceived in their womb muſt be a vine to ſpread all over <hi>Aſia,</hi> nay their very urine to over flow the Citle, like Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> they muſt rule from Sea to Sea, though all they write like him be but in chips, and like <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> they muſt fight it out to the hazard of all, though but for the tribute of a load of Calves-skins, yea though the fruit of the victory, if acquired, cannot be worth the Bits and ſtirrops of the armies they engage.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Grotius</hi> in the like caſe obſerves, They call that peace when they have made a ſolltude, <hi>Si Eccleſia una</hi> (as <hi>Junius</hi> complains) <hi>ſi plures in circumſtantiis, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus, ceremoniis non planè judicio noſtro aut moribus conformantur, plerique omnes cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant de pietate, de Chriſtianitate actum, atque ulinam clamarent ſolum, etſi hi clamores tot ſunt infeſta tela quibus imperitorum mentes obſirmantur &amp; labefactantur infirmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, ſed cum accedunt contumeliae, proſcriptiones, condemnationes &amp; alia id genus, puidſne mi homo illud inſtitutum à Chriſto eſſe aut à Chriſtiano ſui compote probari poſſe? non vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des dum ordinem externum propugnas verbis, eundem ordinem à to ipſo ante omnes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In going off from me, they juſtle with Mr. <hi>Teanes,</hi> that they may like <hi>Caetiana</hi> in <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus, majoribus inimicitiis ineireſcere,</hi> but it is never the eſſe with a tender and gentle touch, reflecting happily on him (as <hi>Eraſmas</hi> ſaid of <hi>Luther</hi>) as a man too great for them to deal with. Every help leſſeneth and detracts from him to whom it is contributed; ſo <hi>plenus extra quid cupiat?</hi> as therefore <hi>Quintilian</hi> ſaid of <hi>Tully, Ad laudandum Ciceronem Cicerone opus eſſe,</hi> ſo there needs none to defend that learned man but himſelf.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It concerns not me to undertake his defence which can be much better made by himſelf. As the <hi>Veſtal</hi> flame going out, was to be rekindled onely by the like ſacred fire; ſo if they would have damped that fire which hath reflected ſo much light, it is onely proper for himſelf to revive and foment it; but I am apt to believe, that as <hi>Socrates</hi> being incited to vindicate himſelf from ſuch aſperſions, ſaid he had done it already by his former courſe of life; ſo Mr. <hi>Humfryes</hi> will think himſelf ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeded of his defence by the ſecond book which he ſet forth, which it had been more opportune and handſome for them to have aſſaied to anſwer
<q>(Ecce tacent omnes, Naevole dic aliquid)</q> then to be nibbling at this, and thereby to deal with him as <hi>Robinet de Bourneville</hi> did with King <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth after the battell of <hi>Agincourt,</hi> who when he durſt not encounter him in his full ſtrength, fell upon the Camp which the King had left leſſe fortified, and formerly marcht out of, to obtain a glorious victory againſt a braver enemy. And therefore however their ambition may be obſerved, yet their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation may be fruſtrate of anſwer,

                  </q> and even pitie will with-hold the laying of any violent hands upon ſuch a faint and feeble object which will ſoon die of it ſelfe, and came forth into life onely to add more credit to Mr. <hi>Humfryes</hi> Tract, and may ſerve as a foile to reflect more luſter upon that Jewell</p>
               <p>Though the Gentleman be known to me onely by the image of his mind pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied in his ſheets, yet it is a due tribute of the mouth (like that of the fiſh,) to ſay of that picture (his b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
